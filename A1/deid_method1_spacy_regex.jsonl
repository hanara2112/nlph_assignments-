The remainder of\nthe great\nvessels are also unremarkable.\n\nSOFT TISSUES: The visualized thyroid gland appears normal.\nThere are several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, none which\nmeet CT size criteria for pathological enlargement. A\nborderline subcarinal lymph node measures 11 mm in the short\naxis (4:107). There are bilateral pathologically enlarged hilar\nlymph nodes, on the right measuring 25 x 18 mm, and on the left\nmeasuring 18 x 8 mm (4:106).

No pleural effusion\nis seen.\n\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: There is an old left rib fracture (2:27), but\nno focal osseous lesions concerning for malignancy.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.\n2. Diffuse bronchitis and lower lobe predominant bronchiolitis\npresenting as Right lower lobe consolidation opacities, which is indicative of an\ninfectious process. The features lack the extensive\nground-glass opacity normally seen in PCP.\nAlthough this could be a common bacterial infection, there are\nfeatures which raise concern for acute tuberculosis, or other\natypical pneumonia.
