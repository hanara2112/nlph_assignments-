# ACUTE ON CHRONIC ABDOMINAL PAIN: Paitient with history of
chronic pancreatitis. Upon reviewing old hospital records
obtained from her PCP Ruiz has only had one attach pf
pancreatitis (lipase 1400). Her pancreatic enzymes were not
elevated on this admission. She did report worsening pain with
eating especially fatty foods. She is status post ERCP with
sphincterotomy. After her first sphyncerotomy her symptoms
improved for almost a year. An MRCP done without secretin only
showed possible pancreatitis without evidence of obstruction.
She improved with bowel rest and pain medication. She was able
to tolarate a clear diet and advanced to a low residue diet. GI
evaluated her and felt this may be related to biliary
restenosis. She will need close GI follow up and possible
repeat ERCP. A work up for other causes of abdmonal pain was
undertaken. ESR was normal, Triglycerides: 126 mg/dL was negative, C1 inhibitor was
normal, IgG was mildly low, Patient noted to be IgA deficient
and thus TTG was unable to rule out celiac.

she was made Full code. She likely would benefit from an
advanced directive.

# ACUTE ON CHRONIC ABDOMINAL PAIN: Paitient with history of
chronic pancreatitis. Upon reviewing old hospital records
obtained from her PCP Ruiz has only had one attach pf
pancreatitis (lipase 1400). Her pancreatic enzymes were not
elevated on this admission. She did report worsening pain with
eating especially fatty foods. She is status post ERCP with
sphincterotomy. After her first sphyncerotomy her symptoms
improved for almost a year. An MRCP done without secretin only
showed possible pancreatitis without evidence of obstruction.
She improved with bowel rest and pain medication. She was able
to tolarate a clear diet and advanced to a low residue diet. GI
evaluated her and felt this may be related to biliary
restenosis. She will need close GI follow up and possible
repeat ERCP. A work up for other causes of abdmonal pain was
undertaken. ESR was normal, Triglycerides: 126 mg/dL was negative, C1 inhibitor was
normal, IgG was mildly low, Patient noted to be IgA deficient
and thus TTG was unable to rule out celiac.
.
# CODE: Patient was initially DNR/DNI. After further discussion
she was made Full code. She likely would benefit from an
advanced directive.

IMAGING:
CXR 2025-07-07:
The lungs are mildly hyperinflated suggesting underlying
obstructive pulmonary disease. No confluent opacity is
identified to suggest pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema or
pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
within normal limits. No
pneumothorax is evident. Healed left-sided rib fractures are
noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA 2025-02-15:
Final Report
FINDINGS:
CT ANGIOGRAM: There are no pulmonary arterial filling defects
to suggest
presence of pulmonary embolism. There is adequate visualization
to the
subsegmental vessels. The aorta is normal in course and
caliber, without
evidence of dissection or intramural hematoma. The remainder of
the great
vessels are also unremarkable.

SOFT TISSUES: The visualized thyroid gland appears normal.
There are several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, none which
meet CT size criteria for pathological enlargement. A
borderline subcarinal lymph node measures 11 mm in the short
axis (4:107). There are bilateral pathologically enlarged hilar
lymph nodes, on the right measuring 25 x 18 mm, and on the left
measuring 18 x 8 mm (4:106). There is no supraclavicular or
axillary lymphadenopathy. This study is not optimized for
evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures. Within these
limitations, minimal nonspecific bilateral perinephric fat
stranding is seen. The stomach is mildly dilated with ingested
material. There are no other gross upper abdominal
abnormalities.
LUNGS: Pneumomediastinum can be seen arising from the right
hilum, extending to the midline and tracking inferiorly
alongside the esophagus and anterior portion of the aorta
(4:134, 102, 601B:32). There is no pneumothorax or
pneumopericardium. There is diffuse bronchial wall thickening
bilaterally (4:135). In addition, there are Consolidation nodular
peripheral opacities, predominantly in the lower lung zones,
more extensive on the left (4:203, 135). No pleural effusion
is seen.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is an old left rib fracture (2:27), but
no focal osseous lesions concerning for malignancy.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Diffuse bronchitis and lower lobe predominant bronchiolitis
presenting as Right lower lobe consolidation opacities, which is indicative of an
infectious process. The features lack the extensive
ground-glass opacity normally seen in PCP.
Although this could be a common bacterial infection, there are
features which raise concern for acute tuberculosis, or other
atypical pneumonia. The bilateral lymphadenopathy is likely
reactive hypertrophy.
3. Pneumomediastinum, likely spontaneous.

Barium swallow 2025-08-05:
A single swallow of Optiray contrast, followed by multiple
swallows
of thin barium showed no evidence of leak or esophageal rupture.
The
esophagus is normal in size and caliber. There is no holdup of
barium at the gastroesophageal junction. Images were obtained
in frontal and oblique
planes.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of esophageal leak or rupture.

Brief Hospital Course:
2001 y/o M with PMHx of HIV (last CD4 last month 365, drop from
800s) on Atripla presenting with SOB and cough, improved with
treatment for CAP, ruled out for TB with induced sputum x3.

# Community acquired pneumonia/Hypoxia: Patient presented with
cough, DOE and hypoxia. Patient with HIV (last known CD4 300+),
however has reported dropping CD4 recently. CD4 84 now but
difficult to interpret in the setting of acute illness. Initial
differential was broad including CAP, PCP, and fungal infection.
Patient initially started on levaquin and Bactrim to cover CAP
and PCP Inflammation. CTA showed no PE and L>R bibasilar Diffuse
infiltrates. The rapid onset suggested bacterial infection and
Bactrim was changed to prophylaxis dose and CAP treatment
switched to CTX/Azithro while patient being ruled out for TB.
Cough treated with Robitussin. Preliminary results from induced
sputum x3 showed negative AFB staining. Patient's hypoxia
resolved with CAP treatment. Patient discharged on cefpodoxime
and azithromycin for a total of 7 day course. Patient to follow
up with PCP and arrange follow up with infectious diseases.

# HIV: Current CD4 84 down from 350s one month ago. However,
this is difficult to interpret with acute illness. HIV VL
undetectable which is encouraging. Patient showed no signs of
opportunistic infections. Continued home dose atripla. Plan to
follow up outpatient infectious diseases. Started on PCP
prophylaxis with 2018.

# Spontaneous pneumomediastinum: Small amount of air was seen in
the mediastinum on CTA. This was likely spontaneous from severe
cough. Thoracics was consulted and recommended Barium swallow
to rule out esophageal rupture (though low likelihood) and
keeping patient NPO. Once Barium swallow was negative for
esophageal rupture, patient returned to regular diet. Thoracics
recommended no further imaging to evaluate pneumomediastium in
the absence of additional symptoms.

# Asthma: Continued albuterol.

# Pain control: Continued home dose Gabapentin, percocet prn and
ibuprofen prn.

# Transitional issues:
- code status: full code
- new meds: Azithromycin, cefpodoxime, Bactrim, robitussin
- pending labs: Blood culture from 2025-04-07, Final results of induced
sputum x3
- follow up: with PCP, Start the prescribed medication and do not miss any doses. help arrange follow up
with infectious diseases)

you with antibiotics and you improved.

Our preliminary cultures showed that you did not have a
tuberculosis infection. The cultures will be finalized on
2025-08-16. We will call you with the results. Until then you
should avoid being near large crowds or immunosuppressed
individuals.

We made the following changes to your medications:
- STARTED Azithromycin (last day Day 7
- STARTED Cefpodoxime (last day Day 10
- STARTED Bactrim (a medication you should continue until
directed by your HIV doctor)

Followup Instructions:
Call the cardiologist immediately if chest pain or shortness of breath occurs.","Name: [NAME] No: 9402

ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):

IMAGING:
CXR [DATE]:
The lungs are mildly hyperinflated suggesting underlying
obstructive pulmonary disease. No confluent opacity is
identified to suggest pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema or
pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
within normal limits. No
pneumothorax is evident. Healed left-sided rib fractures are
noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA [DATE]:
Final Report
FINDINGS:
CT ANGIOGRAM: There are no pulmonary arterial filling defects
to suggest
presence of pulmonary embolism. There is adequate visualization
to the
subsegmental vessels. The aorta is normal in course and
caliber, without
evidence of dissection or intramural hematoma. The remainder of
the great
vessels are also unremarkable.

SOFT TISSUES: The visualized thyroid gland appears normal.
There are several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, none which
meet CT size criteria for pathological enlargement. A
borderline subcarinal lymph node measures 11 mm in the short
axis (4:107). There are bilateral pathologically enlarged hilar
lymph nodes, on the right measuring 25 x 18 mm, and on the left
measuring 18 x 8 mm (4:106). There is no supraclavicular or
axillary lymphadenopathy. This study is not optimized for
evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures. Within these
limitations, minimal nonspecific bilateral perinephric fat
stranding is seen. The stomach is mildly dilated with ingested
material. There are no other gross upper abdominal
abnormalities.
LUNGS: Pneumomediastinum can be seen arising from the right
hilum, extending to the midline and tracking inferiorly
alongside the esophagus and anterior portion of the aorta
(4:134, 102, 601B:32). There is no pneumothorax or
pneumopericardium. There is diffuse bronchial wall thickening
bilaterally (4:135). In addition, there are Consolidation nodular
peripheral opacities, predominantly in the lower lung zones,
more extensive on the left (4:203, 135). No pleural effusion
is seen.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is an old left rib fracture (2:27), but
no focal osseous lesions concerning for malignancy.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Diffuse bronchitis and lower lobe predominant bronchiolitis
presenting as Right lower lobe consolidation opacities, which is indicative of an
infectious process. The features lack the extensive
ground-glass opacity normally seen in PCP.
Although this could be a common bacterial infection, there are
features which raise concern for acute tuberculosis, or other
atypical pneumonia. The bilateral lymphadenopathy is likely
reactive hypertrophy.
3. Pneumomediastinum, likely spontaneous.

Barium swallow [DATE]:
A single swallow of Optiray contrast, followed by multiple
swallows
of thin barium showed no evidence of leak or esophageal rupture.
The
esophagus is normal in size and caliber. There is no holdup of
barium at the gastroesophageal junction. Images were obtained
in frontal and oblique
planes.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of esophageal leak or rupture.

Brief Hospital Course:
2001 y/o M with PMHx of HIV (last CD4 last month 365, drop from
800s) on Atripla presenting with SOB and cough, improved with
treatment for CAP, ruled out for TB with induced sputum x3.

infiltrates. The rapid onset suggested bacterial infection and
Bactrim was changed to prophylaxis dose and CAP treatment
switched to CTX/Azithro while patient being ruled out for TB.
Cough treated with Robitussin. Preliminary results from induced
sputum x3 showed negative AFB staining. Patient's hypoxia
resolved with CAP treatment. Patient discharged on cefpodoxime

measures 8.2 cm and has a homogeneous echotexture. Visualized
portions of the right kidney are within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: Normal abdominal ultrasound.

Brief Hospital Course:
1985 male with epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting found to have
pancreatitis of unclear etiology.

Pancreatitis: Lipase of 400 on admission with nausea at
presentation. He has had 2 other episodes requiring
hospiatlization in the past in 2015, which were attributed to
""not moving his bowels right."" He had pain with the two prior
episodes, but only nausea with this presentation. His appetite
was down and he hadn't been taking food in 32 days due to the
nausea. He denies heavy alcohol use. He denied drug use aside
from marijuana. He had no stones on RUQ. His triglycerides were
48. He is not on any medications at home. Given this is possibly
his third occurrence of pancreatitis over the last year, an MRCP
would be a reasonable next step in evaluation to further
evaluate his anatomy. His lipase normalized and his symptoms
resolved with hydration. He tolerated advancement in his diet
and was discharged in good condition.

Hyperbilirubinemia: His bili was elevated to 2.4 with most of it
being indirect. Question of possible Pneumonia disease, though
hemolysis (mild anemia) is also possible. It was stable on
discharge and may require work-up as an outpatient.

epigastric region. He has not been moving his bowels for the
past few days but previously no issues, no weight loss, no
diarrhea. He denies fevers, had a low grade temp in the [ORG]. He

abd pain about 35 years ago. With the 2 previous episodes the
pain was no terrible he thought that he was going to die. He
came to medical attention this time before it became so bad. He
does not have a hx of abd pain after eating. He does not
