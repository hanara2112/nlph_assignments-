No confluent opacity is\nidentified to suggest pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema or\npleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are\nwithin normal limits. No\npneumothorax is evident. Healed left-sided rib fractures are\nnoted.\nIMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.\n\nCTA [DATE]:\nFinal Report\nFINDINGS:\nCT ANGIOGRAM: There are no pulmonary arterial filling defects\nto suggest\npresence of pulmonary embolism. There is adequate visualization\nto the\nsubsegmental vessels. The aorta is normal in course and\ncaliber, without\nevidence of dissection or intramural hematoma. The remainder of\nthe great\nvessels are also unremarkable.\n\nSOFT TISSUES: The visualized thyroid gland appears normal.\nThere are several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, none which\nmeet [ORG] size criteria for pathological enlargement. A\nborderline subcarinal lymph [ORG] measures 11 mm in the short\naxis (4:107). There are bilateral pathologically enlarged hilar\nlymph nodes, on the right measuring 25 x 18 mm, and on the left\nmeasuring 18 x 8 mm (4:106). There is no supraclavicular or\naxillary lymphadenopathy. This study is not optimized for\nevaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures. Within these\nlimitations, minimal nonspecific bilateral perinephric fat\nstranding is seen. The stomach is mildly dilated with ingested\nmaterial. There are no other gross upper abdominal\nabnormalities.\nLUNGS: Pneumomediastinum can be seen arising from the right\nhilum, extending to the midline and tracking inferiorly\nalongside the esophagus and anterior portion of the aorta\n(4:134, 102, 601B:32). There is no pneumothorax or\npneumopericardium. There is diffuse bronchial wall thickening\nbilaterally (4:135). In addition, there are Consolidation nodular\nperipheral opacities, predominantly in the lower lung zones,\nmore extensive on the left (4:203, 135). No pleural effusion\nis seen.\n\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: There is an old left rib fracture (2:27), but\nno focal osseous lesions concerning for malignancy.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.\n2. [LOCATION] bronchitis and lower lobe predominant bronchiolitis\npresenting as Right lower lobe consolidation opacities, which is indicative of an\ninfectious process. The features lack the extensive\nground-glass opacity normally seen in [ORG].\nAlthough this could be a common bacterial infection, there are\nfeatures which raise concern for acute tuberculosis, or other\natypical pneumonia. The bilateral lymphadenopathy is likely\nreactive hypertrophy.\n3. Pneumomediastinum, likely spontaneous.\n\nBarium swallow [DATE]:\nA single swallow of [ORG] contrast, followed by multiple\nswallows\nof thin barium showed no evidence of leak or esophageal rupture.\nThe\nesophagus is normal in size and caliber.
