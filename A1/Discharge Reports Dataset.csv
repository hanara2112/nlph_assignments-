Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 1984 yo woman with history of chronic pancreatitis
s/p cholecystectomy and sphincterotomy who presents with 1wk of
worsening abdominal pain. As per patient, the pain is
intermittent, sharp and 0/10 (no pain) in quality. It localizes to her
mid/righ upper abdomen and radiates up the chest wall and to the
back. Patient finds this pain to be very similar to her prior
pancreatitis flare-ups. Denies precipitants including alcohol
use, abd. trauma, infections or h/o gallstones. She notes that
she is on a restricted diet (no caffeine/fatty food/fried
food/dairy) as part of her pancreatitis management. Also notes
that pain worsens with meals; and that it is alleviated when
NPO, or with NSAIDs and dilaudid.
.
Patient was initally seen by her PCP Brandon Rubio for worsening
pain. She was treated with PO Zofran and NSAIDs. As pain failed
to improve, she presented to Riverbend Medical ED on 2025-01-25. In the ED vitals
were T 99.6, HR 77, BP 104/56, RR 16, O2 sat 98% on RA. Patient
received 8 mg IV morphine and zofran. She was admitted to
medicine for pain control.

# ACUTE ON CHRONIC ABDOMINAL PAIN: Paitient with history of
chronic pancreatitis. Upon reviewing old hospital records
obtained from her PCP Ruiz has only had one attach pf
pancreatitis (lipase 1400). Her pancreatic enzymes were not
elevated on this admission. She did report worsening pain with
eating especially fatty foods. She is status post ERCP with
sphincterotomy. After her first sphyncerotomy her symptoms
improved for almost a year. An MRCP done without secretin only
showed possible pancreatitis without evidence of obstruction.
She improved with bowel rest and pain medication. She was able
to tolarate a clear diet and advanced to a low residue diet. GI
evaluated her and felt this may be related to biliary
restenosis. She will need close GI follow up and possible
repeat ERCP. A work up for other causes of abdmonal pain was
undertaken. ESR was normal, Triglycerides: 126 mg/dL was negative, C1 inhibitor was
normal, IgG was mildly low, Patient noted to be IgA deficient
and thus TTG was unable to rule out celiac.
.
# CODE: Patient was initially DNR/DNI. After further discussion
she was made Full code. She likely would benefit from an
advanced directive.

IMAGING:
CXR 2025-07-07:
The lungs are mildly hyperinflated suggesting underlying
obstructive pulmonary disease. No confluent opacity is
identified to suggest pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema or
pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
within normal limits. No
pneumothorax is evident. Healed left-sided rib fractures are
noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA 2025-02-15:
Final Report
FINDINGS:
CT ANGIOGRAM: There are no pulmonary arterial filling defects
to suggest
presence of pulmonary embolism. There is adequate visualization
to the
subsegmental vessels. The aorta is normal in course and
caliber, without
evidence of dissection or intramural hematoma. The remainder of
the great
vessels are also unremarkable.

SOFT TISSUES: The visualized thyroid gland appears normal.
There are several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, none which
meet CT size criteria for pathological enlargement. A
borderline subcarinal lymph node measures 11 mm in the short
axis (4:107). There are bilateral pathologically enlarged hilar
lymph nodes, on the right measuring 25 x 18 mm, and on the left
measuring 18 x 8 mm (4:106). There is no supraclavicular or
axillary lymphadenopathy. This study is not optimized for
evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures. Within these
limitations, minimal nonspecific bilateral perinephric fat
stranding is seen. The stomach is mildly dilated with ingested
material. There are no other gross upper abdominal
abnormalities.
LUNGS: Pneumomediastinum can be seen arising from the right
hilum, extending to the midline and tracking inferiorly
alongside the esophagus and anterior portion of the aorta
(4:134, 102, 601B:32). There is no pneumothorax or
pneumopericardium. There is diffuse bronchial wall thickening
bilaterally (4:135). In addition, there are Consolidation nodular
peripheral opacities, predominantly in the lower lung zones,
more extensive on the left (4:203, 135). No pleural effusion
is seen.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is an old left rib fracture (2:27), but
no focal osseous lesions concerning for malignancy.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Diffuse bronchitis and lower lobe predominant bronchiolitis
presenting as Right lower lobe consolidation opacities, which is indicative of an
infectious process. The features lack the extensive
ground-glass opacity normally seen in PCP.
Although this could be a common bacterial infection, there are
features which raise concern for acute tuberculosis, or other
atypical pneumonia. The bilateral lymphadenopathy is likely
reactive hypertrophy.
3. Pneumomediastinum, likely spontaneous.

Barium swallow 2025-08-05:
A single swallow of Optiray contrast, followed by multiple
swallows
of thin barium showed no evidence of leak or esophageal rupture.
The
esophagus is normal in size and caliber. There is no holdup of
barium at the gastroesophageal junction. Images were obtained
in frontal and oblique
planes.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of esophageal leak or rupture.

Brief Hospital Course:
2001 y/o M with PMHx of HIV (last CD4 last month 365, drop from
800s) on Atripla presenting with SOB and cough, improved with
treatment for CAP, ruled out for TB with induced sputum x3.

# Community acquired pneumonia/Hypoxia: Patient presented with
cough, DOE and hypoxia. Patient with HIV (last known CD4 300+),
however has reported dropping CD4 recently. CD4 84 now but
difficult to interpret in the setting of acute illness. Initial
differential was broad including CAP, PCP, and fungal infection.
Patient initially started on levaquin and Bactrim to cover CAP
and PCP Inflammation. CTA showed no PE and L>R bibasilar Diffuse
infiltrates. The rapid onset suggested bacterial infection and
Bactrim was changed to prophylaxis dose and CAP treatment
switched to CTX/Azithro while patient being ruled out for TB.
Cough treated with Robitussin. Preliminary results from induced
sputum x3 showed negative AFB staining. Patient's hypoxia
resolved with CAP treatment. Patient discharged on cefpodoxime
and azithromycin for a total of 7 day course. Patient to follow
up with PCP and arrange follow up with infectious diseases.

# HIV: Current CD4 84 down from 350s one month ago. However,
this is difficult to interpret with acute illness. HIV VL
undetectable which is encouraging. Patient showed no signs of
opportunistic infections. Continued home dose atripla. Plan to
follow up outpatient infectious diseases. Started on PCP
prophylaxis with 2018.

# Spontaneous pneumomediastinum: Small amount of air was seen in
the mediastinum on CTA. This was likely spontaneous from severe
cough. Thoracics was consulted and recommended Barium swallow
to rule out esophageal rupture (though low likelihood) and
keeping patient NPO. Once Barium swallow was negative for
esophageal rupture, patient returned to regular diet. Thoracics
recommended no further imaging to evaluate pneumomediastium in
the absence of additional symptoms.

# Asthma: Continued albuterol.

# Pain control: Continued home dose Gabapentin, percocet prn and
ibuprofen prn.

# Transitional issues:
- code status: full code
- new meds: Azithromycin, cefpodoxime, Bactrim, robitussin
- pending labs: Blood culture from 2025-04-07, Final results of induced
sputum x3
- follow up: with PCP, Start the prescribed medication and do not miss any doses. help arrange follow up

History of Present Illness:
1985 male chef here for work from Port Jesse reports having
starting on 2025-02-28 he began to have terrible epigastric pain.
The pain was located in the epigastric region but then radiated
diffusely throughout the upper abdomen. He also had nausea, but
no vomiting initially. The pain continued in waves
intermittently for a few days and was initially present after
eating but then became present all the time and would get worse
with eating or drinking. He on 2025-07-24 began to have more nausea
and tried taking Kevin Singleton but the taste was so horrible that
he vomited. Since then he has had nausea and vomiting with
trying to eat and feels that there is ""like a ball"" in the
epigastric region. He has not been moving his bowels for the
past few days but previously no issues, no weight loss, no
diarrhea. He denies fevers, had a low grade temp in the ED. He
is very thirsty at this time and report poor urine outpt in teh
past 2 days. He reports an episode of horrible epigastric pain
that occured 2 days after he had what he though was bad fish in
January of this year and a similar episode of again a few days of
abd pain about 35 years ago. With the 2 previous episodes the
pain was no terrible he thought that he was going to die. He
came to medical attention this time before it became so bad. He
does not have a hx of abd pain after eating. He does not
usually see MDs, is otherwise healthy. Is helping a friend with
a restaurant, here in town for about 2 weeks and was feeling

IMPRESSION: Normal abdominal ultrasound.

Brief Hospital Course:
1985 male with epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting found to have
pancreatitis of unclear etiology.

Pancreatitis: Lipase of 400 on admission with nausea at
presentation. He has had 2 other episodes requiring
hospiatlization in the past in 2015, which were attributed to
""not moving his bowels right."" He had pain with the two prior
episodes, but only nausea with this presentation. His appetite
was down and he hadn't been taking food in 32 days due to the
nausea. He denies heavy alcohol use. He denied drug use aside
from marijuana. He had no stones on RUQ. His triglycerides were
48. He is not on any medications at home. Given this is possibly
his third occurrence of pancreatitis over the last year, an MRCP
would be a reasonable next step in evaluation to further
evaluate his anatomy. His lipase normalized and his symptoms
resolved with hydration. He tolerated advancement in his diet
and was discharged in good condition.

Hyperbilirubinemia: His bili was elevated to 2.4 with most of it
being indirect. Question of possible Pneumonia disease, though
hemolysis (mild anemia) is also possible. It was stable on
discharge and may require work-up as an outpatient.

Atypical cells in differential on admission: Resolved on repeat
in the morning.

Transitional issues:
- Establishment of primary care for further work-up.

s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
N/A

History of Present Illness:
2007 yo man with hx of severe dementia (non-verbal, receives help
at home with home health aid), multiple recent falls at home,
BPH, and HTN who presents s/p fall.

Per wife, the home health aid was attempting to dress the
patient
today, and the patient became agitated and fell. She says he
fell
against the bath tub with reported headstrike but no LOC. He has
notable bruising and swelling over the back of his head, left
shoulder, and left forearm. The wife did not witness the fall,
but is recounting history from home health aide.

The aide also stated that he was not complaining of chest pain,
palpitations, or SOB prior to the fall. CT head in the ED was
negative for intra-cranial abnormality, but notable for large
subgleal hematoma. CT c-spine also negative. EKG unchanged from
prior, troponin <0.01. CXR and UA unremarkable, but urine and
blood cultures are pending.

Per report, the patient walks well without any assistance (no
weakness/focal deficits) but has home health aid to help with
ADLs at home. Given recent falls, the family is concerned that
home nursing staff is not watching the patient. They believe
nursing staff are letting him go to the bathroom/walk without
assistance. Case management was consulted in the ED. Given
concern for safety at home, plan to admit to medicine for case
management eval in AM and PT/OT services set up.

In the ED, initial VS were: T: 96.6, HR: 76, BP: 197/108, RR:
18, 97% RA

Exam notable for:
Patient does not respond to questions, intermittently tries to
get up from the bed.
Heart- regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
Lungs - clear to auscultation
Abdomen - nontender, patient does not react to palpation
Neuro - moving all extremities spontaneously, pupils of normal
size but difficult to examine; no apparent focal weakness. Per
family the patient is at his baseline.
Skin - large swelling on the upper/posterior head with small
skin
abrasions; left arm abrasion; left scapular abrasions
Extremities- no cyanosis or edema

ECG: Sinus rhythm, HR 91bpm, 1st degree AV delay, no ST changes

Labs showed:
- Troponin <0.01
- WBC 16.3, HgB 15.7, Hct 46.4, Plt 228
- Chemistry panel, LFTs within normal limits

Imaging showed:
- CT c-spine: No acute fracture or traumatic subluxation.
- CT head:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality or fracture.
2. Bilateral 4 mm low-density subdural fluid collections,
potentially chronic subdural hematomas or hygromas.
3. Large subgaleal hematoma near the skull vertex.
- CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Consults:
Neurosurgery: Collections are chronic hygromas. No need for
repeat imaging. No need for neurosurgical follow up.

Case management:
Unsafe d/c plan, no homecare assistance available. Plan for
patient to remain in hospital to allow for set up of Daycare program
Outpatient therapy to provide respite for spouse and care for the patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Scott with history of severe frontotemporal dementia (essentially
non-verbal), multiple recent falls at home, BPH, and HTN who
presents s/p mechanical fall, with concerns for safety at home.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Falls, home safety
Patient presented to the ED after a fall, likely mechanical in
nature. Per the patient's wife, their home health aid was
attempting to dress the patient, and he fell against the bath
tub. He hit his head but did not lose consciousness. The aide
reported the patient did not have chest pain or SOB prior to the
fall, although the patient appears essentially non-verbal at
baseline. Reassuringly, in the ED, his EKG did not show ischemic
changes, and cardiac biomarkers were negative. HCT showed
bilateral chronic subdural hematomas or hygromas and a large
subgaleal hematoma without acute findings; Neurosurgery was
consulted who felt these findings were most c/w hygromas and
recommended no acute intervention and no further NSGY needed. CT
C-spine showed no acute fracture. The patient reportedly walks
well without assistance but needs help with ADL's at home.
However, in light of recurrent falls over the past year,
evaluation for additional home services was warranted. Patient
was admitted and seen by case management, and ultimately
discharged home with resumption of home care. He was seen in the
ED by physical therapy, who noted that he was at baseline with
respect to his gait and activity.

CM did start the discussion surrounding placement in a memory
care setting. Wife was receptive to the discussion and stated
she knows Mr. Scott will need to eventually transition to
this or a nursing home but she was not ready. She was placed in
contact with Jennifer Adams Senior long term CM.

#Leukocytosis
Patient presented with a WBC 12.4, which normalized by the next
morning. His leukocytosis was thought to be reactive in the
setting of this recent fall. He otherwise had no fevers or
localizing symptoms, and CXR and UA were unremarkable on
admission. Blood and urine cultures were still pending at
discharge but no growth to date.

#HTN, uncontrolled
Patient's blood pressures were noted to be in the 150-160's
systolic. He is not on any home anti-hypertensives. In the
setting of recent falls, intervention was deferred.

#Acute kidney injury
Cr rose on the morning of hospital day 1 to 1.3 from 1.0 on
presentation to the ED. Unclear baseline. Suspect pre-renal 3:2
Acute Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack) poor PO intake while in the ED. Improved with IVFs.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Frontotemporal dementia
Patient is essentially non-verbal and does not follow commands
at baseline. He was continued on home quietiapine 6.25mg each
night as needed for agitation.

#Osteoarthritis
Continued Tylenol PRN

#Constipation
Continued home docusate

#Gout
Continued home colchicine PRN

#Blepharitis/allergic conjunctivitis
Continued home ketotifen fumarate

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Please ensure patient has sufficient home health care to
account for his ADL needs and to help prevent falls
- Planned conversation with Jennifer Adams Senior Long Term CM re:
eventual placement in a more monitored setting (MorningStar
Sunrise SNF vs Sunrise Medical Center, etc)
- Please consider addressing code status with the patient and
his wife depending on what the patient had expressed prior to
progression of his dementia; he is currently full code as per
discussion with pts wife

dimension at the level of L2 with resulting posterior
displacement of the cauda equina.
5. Mild multilevel facet hypertrophy and prominent dorsal
epidural fat and ventral epidural hematoma, results in multilevel
mild spinal canal narrowing, and mild to moderate neural
foraminal stenosis as detailed above.
6. Partially visualized left iliopsoas hematoma measuring 5.2 x
2.1 cm

2025-01-17 CT Right leg: There are displaced comminuted of the right calcaneus

Brief Hospital Course:
William Wright with no PMH who fell of dirt bike striking his head with
trauma burden that includes large L pneumothorax, nasal bone
fractures, R subdural hematoma, L 34 rib fractures, L2-L4
vertebral fractures, inferior/superior pubic rami fractures,
right calcaneal fracture, and left proximal radius fracture. A
left chest tube was placed at an OSH for the left pneumothorax.
He was given tetanus and pain medications and transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital.

In the Mayo Medical Center ED, he was given Ancef and pain was managed with
dilaudid IV. He was evaluated by orthopedics, who splinted his
RLE and recommended operative management for the calcaneal
fracture. The left proximal radius fracture was managed
non-operatively with a sling. Neurosurgery evaluated his
subdural hematoma and recommended repeat head CT, Keppra 1 g BID
for seizure ppx, Q1h neuro checks, and TBI pathway. Spine
recommended MRI L-spine, which on wet read demonstrated a spinal
epidural hematoma in the area of his L2-L4 fractures; spine
recommended log roll precautions, TLSO brace, and trending neuro
exam. He was managed in the Trauma ICU.

When stable, he was transferred to the surgical floor.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a hydromorphone
PCA and and then transitioned to oral oxycodone, gabapentin,
toradol, acetaminophen, lidocaine patches and Tizanidine prn.
The Acute Pain Service was consulted to help with pain
management. The patient had a standing L spine x-ray (in the
TLSO brace) on HD8 which showed show good alignment of L-spine
with bracing. CT Head from 2025-01-17 was reviewed and showed no
evidence of acute intracranial process or hemorrhage, therefore
keppra was discontinued.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization. The patient had interval
chest x-rays to evaluate the left pneumothorax. The left chest
tube was removed on HD7 and interval chest x-rays were obtained.
The patient remained stable on room air in no acute respiratory
distress.

GI/GU/FEN: The patient tolerated a regular diet without issue.
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored.

ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of
infection, of which there were none.

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs of
bleeding, of which there were none.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and Infusion pump dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

Musculoskeletal: The Orthopedic Surgery service evaluated the
patient's right calcaneal fracture and felt that it would best
be managed non-operatively.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
and hemodynamically stable. The patient was offered the
Meds-to-Bed service and declined. The patient was tolerating a
diet, moving out of bed independently, voiding without
assistance, and pain was controlled. The patient received
discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Wright,

You were admitted to Mayo Medical Center after
falling off a dirt bike and you were found to have a traumatic
brain injury, nasal bone fractures, a sternal fracture and
multiple left rib fractures, a left pneumothorax (abnormal air
within the lung lining due to a lung puncture), spine fractures,
a right fibula (lower leg bone) fracture, a left radial head
fracture (forearm bone), left pelvic fractures, and a right heel
fracture. The Neurosurgery service was consulted for your
internal head injury as well as for your spine fractures. For
your traumatic brain injury, you were initially started on a
medication, called Keppra, to prevent seizures. This medication
was stopped as it was no longer needed and your repeat head CT
scan was stable. Your spine fractures are in stable alignment
with your TLSO brace.

For your left lung injury, a chest tube was placed to help
evacuate the air from your lung lining. Follow-up chest x-rays
were obtained and your chest tube was removed when it was no
longer needed. Your rib fractures will heal on their own.

The Plastic Surgery service evaluated your nasal bone fractures
and these will heal on their own.

The Orthopedic Surgery service evaluated your arm fractures,
pelvic fractures, and right heel fracture. Your right heel
fracture was deemed non-operative. It is recommended that you
remain non-weight bearing on the right leg, weight bear as
tolerated on the left leg, and do not bear weight on the left
arm.

You were seen by the Acute Pain Service to help establish an
oral pain control regimen. You will be discharged home with a
week of pain medication. Please contact your primary care
provider to arrange for outpatient follow-up within one week for
evaluation and to address your pain medication.

You were evaluated by Physical Therapy and you are cleared to be
discharged home to continue your recovery. Please follow the
instructions below to continue your recovery:

Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the
Emergency Department for any of the following:

*You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or
tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your
medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea,
or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid
heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a
bowel movement.
*You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your
urine, or experience a discharge.
*Your pain in not improving within 34 hours or is not gone
within 24 hours. Call or return immediately if your pain is
getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or
back.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees
Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern
you.

Please resume all regular home medications, unless specifically
advised not to take a particular medication. Also, please take
any new medications as prescribed.

Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times
per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids. Avoid lifting
weights greater than 50 kg lbs until you follow-up with your
surgeon.
Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain
medications.

Incision Care:
*Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have
increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision
site.
*Avoid swimming and baths until your follow-up appointment.
*You Approved shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap
and warm water. Gently pat the area dry.
*If you have staples, they will be removed at your follow-up
appointment.
*If you have steri-strips, they will fall off on their own.
Please remove any remaining strips 34 days after surgery.

*Monitor brace at edge of bed, no twisting.

Chief Complaint:
SOB, DOE, b/l Bilateral legs edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right-sided PICC placement
Echocardiography guided line placement for CVVH
CVVH with ultrafiltration

History of Present Illness:
1989 year-old female with a history of chronic systolic CHF (EF
15%), HTN, morbid obesity, and asthma who presents with
increasing SOB, DOE, b/l Bilateral legs edema, and weight gain. She was
hospitalized from 2025-01-01 to 2025-02-27 for decompensated CHF and
was diuresed aggressively (40 lbs off) with Lasix gtt and IV
Diuril. She was re-admitted a few days later for abdominal pain
and also found to be in acute renal failure. She was discharged
on a reduced dose of torsemide and also told to stop her
lisinopril, HCTZ, and spironolactone. When seen in UnityPoint Hospital clinic at
the end of December, she appeared to still be euvolemic and
arrangements were made to have her weight at home transmitted to
Oncology, as she did not formerly weigh herself at home. Her weight
had increased by 30 lbs by the end of December and was told to
increase her torsemide to twice a day, but her weight continued
to increase to 360 lbs by 2025-01-14 and she started to become more
SOB and wheezy. In addition, her BP was noted to be 80/60 and
her O2 sat on RA was 92%. She was reluctant to come to the
hospital and so the plan was to increase torsemide to 80mg bid
if her SBP was >90. However, her SOB continued to get worse and
she presented to the ED.

In the ED her VS were 97, 73, 102/59, 19, 100% on 4L NC (on 2L
NC at home at baseline). A Foley catheter was placed. She was
given 80mg Lasix IV and put out 1400cc. EKG was unchanged from
prior. CXR showed mild fluid overload. Bilateral LENIs were
negative for DVT. She had no chest pain and was breathing and
speaking comfortably. She was admitted for decompensated CHF.

Past Medical History:
- NSVT & low EF; had been considered for ICD due to NSVT and
low EF, but not felt to be a candidate given poor compliance and
other comorbidities
- AVNRT: evaluated by EP in the past, pt not interested in any
further intervention

IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study secondary to patient body
habitus. No evidence of lower extremity DVT.

CHEST (PA & LAT) 2025-01-14 9:11 10:41 PM
IMPRESSION: A mild congestive failure with stable marked
cardiomegaly.

Right Upper Ext ultrasound 2025-01-14:
No DVT in the right upper extremity.

CXR 2025-01-14:
Marked cardiomegaly is stable. haziness of the perihilar regions
is new consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Right
PICC tip is in the proximal SVC. There is no pneumothorax. If
any, there is a small left pleural effusion.

TTE 2025-01-14:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 1995 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial mitral
leaflet flail (anterior leaflet). At least moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the highly eccentric (posterior)
trajectory of the regurgitant flow, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly underestimated (Coanda
effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At
least moderate Mild tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of 2025-04-25, partial flail anterior mitral leaflet is now
present. The mitral regurgitation may be increased, and may be
significantly underestimated on this study due to the Coanda
effect. The left ventricular ejection fraction is increased on
the current study. The pulmonary artery pressure is now markedly
increased.

CXR 2025-01-14:
The tip of the PICC line lies in the mid to upper SVC.
The heart remains markedly enlarged but failure is not currently
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
1989 with chronic systolic CHF (EF 15%) from non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy thought to be due to cocaine abuse, HTN, and
morbid obesity admitted with decompensated heart failure and
acute renal failure.

# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:
Patient triggered for hypotension on day of admission with SBP
80 requiring ICU stay, during which time PICC line was placed
for access and pt was initiated on furosemide drip at 10mg/hr.
Baseline SBP 80-100's during ICU stay for 1 day. Carvedilol was
held given hypotension. Lisinopril was restarted at low dose
2.5mg po daily and was tolerating well. Pt aggressively
diuresed with lasix drip, uptitrated to 12mg/hr, and
spironolactone was added. Diuril 500mg IV was intermittently
added for goal neg 2500 mL/day. We repleted lytes aggressively,
and pt was maintained on 1.5L fluid restriction as well as a low
sodium diet.

After diuresing 20kg on the lasix gtt, the patient's creatinine
began to climb. She was switched to oral diuretics, but
creatinine continued to increase, and all diuretics as well as
her lisinopril were held. When creatinine continued to rise,
nephrology was consulted and recommended CVVH to help with
removing fluid as she was still significantly volume overloaded.

She had a catheter placed by Cardiology and was transferred to the CCU
to undergo CVVH. She underwent CVVH and 30kg of fluid was
removed. She went down to 273lbs (dry weight felt to be 300lbs
per documentation). Her Cr however continued to rise and thus UF
was discontinued and further diuresis was held. Lasix was not
resumed prior to transfer back to floor. In addition, no
afterload reducing agents could be given as patient's BP would
not tolerate it; thus isordil and hydralazine were held.

Upon return to the floor, further diuretics were held, and
patient's Creatinine decreased to 1.7 on the day of discharge.
At the time of discharge, she was on torsemide 40mg BID as well
as carvedilol 3.125mg BID. Her lisinopril and spirinolactone
were being held in the setting of relatively low blood
pressures; these agents will likely need to be restarted as an
outpatient.

# h/o AVNRT & NSVT:
Remained in NSR during admission with rare episodes of
significant NSVT. Patient had been evaluated by EP for ICD
placement, but she was not considered a candidate for pacemaker
given her comorbidities & non compliance with medications and
appointments. Her electrolytes were repleted aggressively.
Although her carvedilol has been held in the setting of
hypotension and acute heart failure, it was restarted during CCU
course. She was placed on 3.125mg BID. She was given follow-up
with EP as an outpatient in the hopes that she might be able to
better comply with appointments after her significant diuresis.

# Acute renal failure:
Likely hemodynamic due to poor forward flow given her depressed
ejection fraction and continued diuresis. Although her
creatinine initially improved with diuresis, it began to climb
as discussed above. Whe renal was consulted, it was recommended
that she undergo CVVH for continued volume removal. She was
transferred the CCU and underwent aggressive fluid removal wtih
CVVH. However her Cr continued to stay elevated. She did have a
hypontensive episode into the 168/110 mmHg and there was concern that she
may have ATN Dr. Arjun Singh (Family Physician) hypotension; however urine sediment did not
show muddy brown casts. UF was stopped and Lasix held given
renal function and monitored.

At the time of discharge, her Cr was 1.7 and she was restarted
on torsemide 40mg BID. Her weight was 123kg (272-275lbs). She
had follow-up with nephrology.

# UTI:
Patient was found to have a pan-sensitive E coli UTI during her
hospital stay. Her Foley catheter was changed and she was
started on bactrim on 2025-01-14. Because bactrim can cause the
creatinine to be increased (without actually causing true renal
failure), her bactrim was switched to keflex on 2025-01-14. She
completed the abx course.

# Asthma/COPD: Continued albuterol, atrovent, and advair.

# Gout: continued home allopurinol

# GERD:
Patient was continued on a PPI per her home regimen, but when
her creatinine worsened, the PPI was stopped. On the day of
discharge, she complained of ""gastritis"" pain that improved with
pepto bismol. She was discharged on omeprazole, sucralfate, and
maalox.

# Depression/anxiety: continued home regimen Celexa

# Hyponatremia:
Patient had hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of
significant diuresis. Her sodium improved as her fluid shifted
into the vascular space.

FULL CODE

# Access: Although she had a PICC during her stay, this was
removed prior to discharge (especially given her h/o drug
abuse).

Chief Complaint:
Weakness, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with PCI 2025-03-30

History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF THE PRESENTING ILLNESS:
Timothy Martinez with complicated past medical history who presents with
about 1 month of weakness and hypotension.

Mr. Timothy Martinez's primary complaint is 2 weeks of generalized
weakness and hypotension. His metoprolol was recently stopped
due to BPs below his baseline (prior baseline ON
antihypertensives was 140, now 90-100 off BP meds). He gets
lightheaded when SBP 90. His HD team was unable to finish HD
today b/c of hypotension down to systolics in the 110/84 mmHg and
weakness (he was fully dialyzed but with minimal volume removal,
currently 101kg post-HD with dry weight of 100kg). His wife
brought him to the ED due to this persistent hypotension.

This comes in the contxt of a very complicated recent course:

He had a recent admission 2025-01-27 for fever thought to be due to
bacteremia and PNA (though source never confirmed) during which
he had an NSTEMI that was medically managed. On that admission
stress showed inferior mild reversible perfusion defect at the
apex, moderate fixed inferior wall perfusion defect. An
echocardiogram showed asymmetric septal hypertrophy with mild
global LV systolic dysfunction with an estimated EF of 45-50%.

He saw his cardiologist (Ashlee Chan) in follow up 2025-02-19 with
complaint of hypotension and weakness. To r/o cardiac cause he
had an ECHO which showed newly depressed EF: ""Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely
depressed (LVEF= EF 60% %) with relative preservation of the
lateral wall and profound hypokinesis of the septum. Left
ventricular dysnchrony is present. A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded."" Also had a Holter monitor
without significant arrhythmia noted. Given LV thrombus, he was
scheduled for cardiac MRI today but missed the apt due to the
events at HD as above.

He also has a chronic R lateral malleolus wound being treated by
his podiatrist Dr. William Bass. This was evaluated by podiatry
inpatient at Royal Free Hospital during 2025-02-08 admission and it was felt that
it was not infected. Per wife this has grown in size and also
has begun to express foul smelling odor. She says the outpt
podiatrist reported that the wound was ""very close to the bone""
when he debrided it. Superficial culture has been ""prelim
concerning for staph"" but no final speciation reported. He
started HD dosing of vanco with 2nd dose today).

In the ED, initial vitals were: 96.5 80 105/63 14 100% 3L NC.
Labs notable for Cr 5.1 (at baseline), hgb 13 (at baseline), no
leukocytosis. Trop 0.63 with normal ck/mb. CXR neg. Ankle x ray
showed Soft tissue ulceration inferior to the right lateral
malleolus without radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis. EKG
showed SR @ 81, NA, PR 204ms/QTc 491, TWI I/aVL and 1mm STE
V1/V2 CWP. He received: IV cefepime.

On the floor, he denies any current or recent chest pain, sob,
orthopnea beyond baseline orthopnea. He's had no fevers. He has
no pain at R lateral malleolus (he has neuropathy to the knee).

Past Medical History:
ESRD (on HD since 2025-02-08, AVF in forearm, Right arm)
CAD status-post MI in 2025 status-post PTCAx2 at Melaniemouth, STEMI

IMAGING/STUDIES:
====================
2025-07-12 FOCUSED TTE
FOCUSED STUDY- Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately to severely depressed (LVEF <30 %) with dyskinesis of
the apex and distal septum, akinesis of the basal to mid septum,
and hypokinesis of all other segments. The basal lateral wall is
relatively preserved in contractility. The right ventricle is at
least mildly dilated with mild to moderate global hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.

2025-07-12 X RAY ANKLE
Soft tissue ulceration inferior to the right lateral malleolus
without
radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis. Please note that MRI
is a more
sensitive examination for the detection of osteomyelitis.

2025-07-12 MR Thorax contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. No MR evidence of osteomyelitis.
2. There is a small amount of non-specific edema in the
calcaneus just
inferior to a chronic fracture in the posterior superior
calcaneus.
2. Diffuse edema in the plantar muscles may be related to
denervation or
myositis.

2025-07-12 Cath:
Coronary Anatomy
Dominance: Right
* Left Main Coronary Artery
The LMCA is calcified without significant stenosis.
* Left Anterior Descending
There is a 99% stenosis in the Proximal LAD. The lesion has a
TIMI flow of 2 and has severe calcification
noted. This lesion is further described as tubular. An
intervention was performed on the Proximal LAD
with a final stenosis of 0%. There were no lesion complications.
* Circumflex
The Circumflex hjas poroximal calcification and mild eccentric
stenosis.
Beyond OM1 there is 70% stenosis.
* Right Coronary Artery
The RCA is totally occluded at site of prior Admission thrombosis.
Interventional Details
A 6 18 Fr Suprapubic XB LAD 4 provided good support. A Prowater wire was
first placed in circumflex for
protection and the LAD lesion was then crossed with a second
Prowater wire. The lesion was predilated
with 2.5 x 15 balloon at 12 ATM. A 3.0 x 16 Promus DES was
deployed at 16 ATM with proximal edge
just inside the left main and post dilated with 3.5 x 12 balloon
at 120/80 mmHg ATM. Final angiography showed
no residual, TIMI 3 flow and no dissection. There was no
compromise of the left circumflex.
Intra-procedural Complications: None

Impressions:
1. Severe 3 vessel CAD with culprit ostial LAD lesion.
2. Successful Colonoscopy.
Recommendations
1. Continue aspirin 81 mg daily; Plavix 75 mg daily.

2025-07-12 06:45AM BLOOD Calcium-10.1 Phos-4.2 Mg-2.2.2 mg/dL&P: Timothy Martinez man with complicated past medical history including
CAD s/p multiple MI and 2x stents, CHF, ESRD on HD, T2DM with
chronic foot ulcer and prior osteomyelitis, prior bacteremia
with MDR organisms, p/w one month of weakness and hypotension of
unclear etiology, most likely cardiac in origin or sympathetic
dysregulation.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#Hypotension: Presented with lower blood pressures over past
month requiring stopping his home metoprolol and limiting
ability to take off fluid at HD (SBPs as low as 110/84 mmHg at HD). ECHO
prior to admission showed newly depressed EF (<30%). AM cortisol
was 29 ruling out adrenal insufficiency. Sepsis thought unlikely
given chronicity of hypotension, negative blood cultures, and
ultimately MRI without evidence of osteo. Hypovolemic etiology
unlikely as pt actually above his dry weight due to difficulty
removing fluid at HD recently. No e/o bleed. Given hypotension
and concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy as etiology, he
underwent cath, further details below. He was also started on
Midodrine 5mg tid on dialysis days which he tolerated well.
Patient's SBPs at discharge were: 110s.

#CAD: Patient with echo with decreased EF (45-50% in 2025-02-08, now
30%), which was concerning for missed MI. 2025-07-06 stress test
showed reversible ischemia. In setting of ESRD, troponins were
difficult to interpret. Patient had Cardiac Catheterization on
2025-04-23 which found severe 3 vessel CAD with culprit ostial LAD
lesion and so DES to LAD. Patient was transferred to the
Cardiology service for further management of high risk PCI.
Increased Atorva to 80, was on 40 for unclear reason. Patient's
Metoprolol was held given hypotension. Continued ASA 81mg,
Plavix.

#Chronic CHFrEF (EF 30%): As above, newly depressed EF on recent
TTE. He did not have clinical evidence of an acute exacerbation
this admission. As above, all antihypertensives were held.
Likely not ICD candidate given history of chronic foot ulcer and
also chronic suprapubic catheter. Volume diuresis with HD 13,
Th, Monday.

#Non healing L malleolus ulcer: Initially concerning for
ostemomyelitis per his outpatient nephrologist Dr. Mary Rios DDS.
MRI showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. Given recent increase
in purulence/drainage of ulcer, he was started on 2 week course
with vanco/ceftaz dosed at HD for skin/soft tissue infection.
However, Ceftaz was stopped given low suspicion for infection.
Vancomycin was continued per request of Podiatry team.

#LV Thrombus: Initial concern for LV thrombus on outpatient
ECHO. This was ruled out on repeat TTE with IV Lumason dye.
Patient was briefly on a heprarin drip which was discontinued
when the ECHO was performed.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#CKD: Continued on HD 13. Continued sevelemer, nephrocaps,
cinacalcet.

#AV fistula: His fistula has had problems with low flows and
poor clearances and recently had a fistulagram and angioplasty
of a stenosis above its aneurysms. Fistula was usable this
admission.

#DM: Continued NPH dosing at 40 U BID, ISS, gabapentin.

#Neurogenic Bladder: Has chronic suprapubic catheter in place
and often has asymptomatic bacturia. He had MDR history and is
well-known to the ID service, who has recommended that pt's
bacteuria NOT be treated as it is chronic for the patient and
simply leads to antibiotic resistance. Urine was not cultured
this admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===========================
 He was started on midodrine on HD days. He should also take
midodrine on NON-HD days if his SBP < 90 or if symptomatic
 Continue vancomycin for two week course, up to and including
2025-02-08, dosed at HD for skin/soft tissue infection of right
foot.
 Last colonoscopy 2025-02-08, recommended repeat in 2 years due
to prep quality and one small polyp, due 2025-02-08.
 Needs cardiology follow up. The patient declined an
appointment with his current cardiologist, Dr. Ashlee Chan
preferred to be discharged with plan to switch to a new
cardiologist as an outpatient. Dr. Abigail Caldwell is aware of this and
will refer the patient to a new cardiologist.
 Should be on Emily Jacobs because of EF < 30%, however given
hypotension on admission this was held. Restart if BP improves
as outpatient.
 Should be on Metoprolol for CHF, however given low BPs had to
stop on this admission. Please re-evaluate BPs to determine when
to restart.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Timothy Martinez:

You were admitted because of low blood pressures and generally
feeling weak. You had a cardiac cath which showed a narrowing in
one of the major blood vessels that brings blood to your heart
(the LAD) so a drug-eluting Bioabsorbable (DES) was placed. You had an
MRI of your foot which did NOT show any signs of infection of
the bone, so you will undergo a 2 week course of two antibiotics
for infection of the skin (Leslie Snyder) with vancomycin at
dialysis. You were started on a medication called midodrine to
keep your blood pressures up, which should be taken three times
per day on the days you get dialysis. If your blood pressures
are less than 90 on the days you do NOT get dialysis, or if you
are symptomatic (dizzy, weak, lightheaded) on those days, you
should take the midodrine three times per day on those days as
well.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

It was a pleasure to care for you.

Your Radiology Team

sphincteroplasty

History of Present Illness:
2012 yo M, hx of rectal CA s/p colectomy with ostomy, severe
anxiety, s/p recent open CCY for choledocholithiasis, c/b wound
infection, UTI and lower extremity edema, who presents for
elective ERCP for stent pull. Underwent ERCP with successful
sphincterotomy, stent pull and sphincteroplasty.
.
History provided by patient, as well as his family members, wife
and daughter (HCP) at the bedside in the post-procedure area in
the Advanced Endoscopy unit.
.
Pt reports stopping Coumadin 5 days prior to procedure. He
reports that he has never previously been on Lovenox or heparin
bridge for procedures. He currently complains of some mild
post-procedure nausea, which has responded to IV Zofran, but
denies any fevers, chills, abd pain, chest pain or SOB.
.
He reports that since his discharge on 2025-06-15, his West Davidchester edema has
improved significantly, although 1 dose of Lasix was held on
2025-06-15 due to weight loss of > 3 lbs (down to 179lbs on 2025-06-15). He
reports that his wound vac has not been bothering him. Of note,
routine AM labs today note WBC# of 20K, and he does note some
chills at home and his wife reports more loose BM's in his
ostomy bag. He also reports some occ vague abdominal pain /
pressure around his ostomy site, although he currently has none.
He denies N/V, fever, melena / hematochezia in the ostomy. He
denies dysuria, cough, SOB. He does note urinary frequency and
nocturia but this has been a chronic problem and he was just
seen in Urology Clinc and his urinary symptoms were felt to be
most likely residual symptoms from recent UTI. Otherwise he
denies
any other symptoms except his baseline anxiety. He wishes to be
discharged to home as soon as safely possible.
.
Recent hospital admissions / evaluations:
1. Admitted 2025-07-15 - 2025-07-04 for SOB, presumptive dx of ILI vs
atypical PNA, discharged to home on course of PO antibiotics.
.
2. Admitted 2025-04-15 for abd pain, F/C, found to have MDR-E.
coli sepsis and bacteremia from cholangitis, underwent ERCP with
biliary stent and DC'ed to home on 2 week course of carbapenem IV
via PICC.
.
3. Seen and discharged from ED on 2025-06-15 for melanotic stools.
Had stable vital signs and Hct, felt to be some mild post-ERCP
bleeding.
.
4. Admitted 2025-04-15 admitted to Hepatobiliary Surgery for
elective open CCY. He received a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin
for empiric therapy for UTI, but his urine culture ultimately
returned No Growth.
.
5. Seen and discharged from ED on 2025-06-15 for wound infection and
possible UTI. Was sent home on course of Keflex for wound
infection and nitrofurantoin for UTI. Ultimately both wound and
urine cx grew similar strains of E. coli.
.
6. Admitted 2025-07-15 - 2025-07-04 to Surgery for worsening West Davidchester edema and
wound evaluation. His Keflex was stopped and he had a wound vac
placed. For his West Davidchester edema, ultrasound was negative for DVT. TTE
was concerning for diastolic HF, so he was started on diuresis
with good effect. He was ultimately discharged on standing PO
Lasix 20mg daily. Repeat urine culture from 2025-06-15 was negative
for infection, but he was continued on his previously determined
course of nitrofurantoin.

2025-06-12 ERCP
Impression:
The previously placed plastic biliary stent was found in good
position at the major papilla.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position over
the previously placed biliary stent using a needle-knife.
The previously placed plastic biliary was then removed using a
snare.
Successful biliary duct cannulation using a sphincterotome.
A single 12 mm oval stone that was causing partial obstruction
was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
There was mild diffuse post-obstructive dilation of the common
bile duct, common hepatic duct, and right and left main hepatic
ducts with the CBD measuring 12 mm.
Balloon sphincteroplasty was performed using a 12mm wire-guided
CRE balloon that was introduced for dilation successfully at the
biliary sphincter.
Multiple stones, debris, and sludge were extracted successfully
using multiple sweeps of the extraction balloon.
Final occlusion cholangiogram showed no remaining filling
defects.
There was excellent flow of bile and contrast at the end of the
procedure.
Otherwise normal ERCP to third part of the duodenum.

2025-06-15 Blood Cultures x 2 sets: NGTD, final PENDING
2025-06-15 C. diff toxin: POSITIVE

Brief Hospital Course:
2012 yo M with hx of rectal CA, s/p hemicolecomty and ostomy,
severe anxiety, A-fib on Coumadin, recent admission for open
CCY, c/b wound infection, UTI, volume overload, now presents for
elective ERCP for stent removal, s/p successful ERCP, noted to
have incidental leukocytosis.
.
# Choledocholithiasis - previously complicated by cholangitis,
s/p ERCP with stent placement, open CCY, now s/p elective ERCP
with successful stent pull, sphincterotomy and sphincteroplasty.
He tolerated the procedure well and his diet was advanced
quickly, which he tolerated. His Coumadin and aspirin were
held, but were resumed on day of discharge (POD #3), per d/w
ERCP team. The ERCP team recommended Jonathan Lynch
antibiotics x 5 days for prophylaxis. He received
fluoroquinolone therapy, initially with ciprofloxacin, which was
then transitioned to levofloxacin to cover his PNA as well.
.
# Leukocytosis / #PNA / # C. diff - Incidental elevated WBC on
admission labs. Given prior hx of C. diff, reports of loose BM
and chills at home, frequent recent abx and ongoing need for
abx, he was started on empiric Rx for recurrent C. diff with PO
Vancomyinc. His C. diff toxin did return POSITIVE. His UA and
Urine Cx were NOT c/w infection. Blood cultures were drawn and
show NGTD. His open CCY wound was felt to be healing well and
NOT actively infected. Although he did not complain of SOB, he
did have a mildly productive cough and CXR confirmed a RML
pneumonia. He was switched from periprocedural coverage with
ciprofloxacin to levofloxacin to cover for pneumonia as well as
post-ERCP prophylaxis. He will receive a 7 day course of
antibiotics for PNA and will receive a 21 day course of PO
Vancomycin for C. diff (to extend for 2 weeks after completion
of fluorquinolone). He should have repeat CXR in 4 weeks to
assess for resolution of infiltrate.
.
# Wound infection - pt had recently undergone open CCY with
wound complicated by wound infection with wound vac in place.
On admission, he was evaluated by the Hepatobiliary Surgery
team, and his wound was felt to be healing well. Wound vac was
changed twice during the hospitalization, including on day of
discharge. He was also followed by the Cardiology RN consult
service. The plan is to continue with wound vac on discharge
for a few more weeks and he will be followed in the
Hepatobiliary Surgery Clinic.
.
# Atrial fibrillation - CHADS2 score is 2 vs 4, as his TIA hx is
questionable. Per d/w his PCP, low suspicion for true CVA/TIA
in the past, so he has not been bridged in the past. Per d/w
ERCP, ok to resume systemic AC on POD#3. His HR was
well-controlled on his home CCB regimen. No bridging therapy
for anticoagulation was given during hospitalization or on
discharge. He is resuming his previous home Coumadin regimen of
Coumadin 3mg 2x/week Thursday and Thursday and Coumadin 2mg 5x/week.
Nephrology Associates will draw his next INR on 2025-06-15. Mayo Medical Center
clinic will continue to follow and the clinic was notified of
discharge anticoagulation plan via email.
.
# Volume overload - he is only mildly volume overload on exam
with trace peripheral edema. Lasix was held during
hospitalization due to NPO status and ongoing infection. He was
tolerating a PO diet well on day of discharge, so he should
resume Lasix on discharge.
.
# Anxiety - pt with severe anxiety. On SSRI and 2 BZD's at
baseline. Per d/w pt's family and his outpatient providers,
there have been numerous adjustments to his medication regimen.
Based on pt and family preferences, will plan for the following
regimen:
- sertraline 75mg po QPM
- alprazolam 0.25mg po BID
- clonazepam 0.5mg po QHS PRN sleep
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. complete course of PO Levaquin (last day = 2025-06-15 to cover
his PNA as well as Seizure prophylaxis
2. complete course of PO vancomycin for C. diff, course to
extend to 2 weeks after completion of Levaquin. Last day = 2025-06-15.
3. Resume Coumadin at home regimen, next INR draw on 2025-06-15 by
Nephrology Associates.
4. Repeat CXR in 4 weeks to assess for resolution of his PNA /
infiltrate.
5. Continue wound vac and f/u with Hepatobiliary Surgery Clinic

Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
chest tube placement
right femoral central venous catheter placement
left femoral central venous catheter placement
(prior to transfer she was intubated)

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Hebert is a 1987 lady who is 12 weeks pregnant and was
transferred from an OSH after VFib arrest, prolonged CPR,
intubation, and cooling protocol.

Per family's report, she had been stressed recently as she is in
her last year of law school. She took a 2 hour exam yesterday.
Apparently was in a verbal altercation with her significant
other (police did question and release him). She was doing fine
until this morning when her mother noted her to look somewhat
short of breath. Then she collapsed to the ground, was
breathing deeply in distress and then she became unconscious.
After a few minutes had passed and nobody could wake her up, her
fiance began chest compressions and EMS was called.

EMS arrived and started CPR; initial rhythm was VF. She was
coded for 20 minutes, receiving defibrillation x5, Amiodarone,
Lidocaine, and Epinephrine x4.

On arrival to Narayana Health, she was in VFib VS on
arrival were T 96.8, BP 73/51, HR 107, RR 10. She had no
spontaneous pulse or respiration, heart sounds were not audible,
GCS 3 with pupils fixed and dilated. She was coded for 90
minutes at the OSH, receiving defibrillation x3, Epi x11,
Amiodarone 300, Lidocaine 100, bicarb x6. Started
Norepinephrine and Phenylephrine. After 90 minutes, she had
ROSC. Was cooled to 31 degrees and was transferred to National University Hospital.

On arrival to National University Hospital ED, initial VS were HR 130, BP 95/50, O2 sat
93% on A/C with RR 20, TV 550, PEEP 8, FiO2 100%. Labs were
notable for WBC 24, Hct 43, plt 266. BUN 15/Cr 1.3. Lactate
6.9. CXR showed left-sided pneumothorax and right-sided
aspiration or extensive atelectasis. CT head with diffuse
cerebral edema, no herniation. CT C-spine and CTA chest showed
left apical pneumothorax, incompletely imaged bilateral
dependent parenchymal consolidative opacities, and right 35648
rib fractures. SBP was persistently in the 111/98 mmHg so right
femoral CVL was placed and Epinephrine drip was added. Left
chest tube was placed for pneumothorax with repeat CXR showing
decrease in size of pneumothorax. She was given Vanc & Zosyn in
case of infection. Cooling protocol was initiated and she was
admitted to the CCU. VS prior to transfer were BP 90/50, HR 80,
on A/C with RR 20, TV 550, PEEP 8, FiO2 100%.

Past Medical History:
-no major medical issues per family
-12 weeks pregnant; this is her 4th attempt attempt at pregnancy over
the past year per fiance (one abortion for trisomy)

Social History:
Sedentary lifestyle
Family History:
Per family members, no family history of sudden cardiac death.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of 2025-07-23 12:19 02:37 PM
Status post chest tube placement with likely decrease in
pneumothorax though the exact extent is difficult to assess on
this supine film. Lenticular opacity over the left upper chest
may be artifact from external structure/soft tissue, or other
device vs unlikely possible pleural or chest wall hematoma at
the site of chest tube insertion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Hebert is a 1987 lady who was 12-weeks pregnant and no
history of drug use who had a witnessed arrest at home. She was
found to be in VFib and received multiple defibrillator shocks &
prolonged ACLS before ROSC. She was transferred to National University Hospital on 2
pressors, intubated.

Here, she was treated for a pneumothorax with a chest tube,
received empiric antibiotics in case of pneumonia based on
?consolidation on imaging, and was ruled out for PE with CTA.
Bedside TTE showed severe global hypokinesis including RV
dilation with free wall hypokinesis. She was started on the
post-arrest cooling protocol. Per Ob/Gyn, not a candidate for
fetal delivery as <21 weeks. Serum tox screen was negative.

On arrival to the CCU, her blood pressures fell despite
escalation to 4 pressor support and IV fluids, and consideration
was given to IABP placement. But BP continued to fall
drastically and patient's family was aware of her poor
prognosis; when her blood pressure became almost undetectable
they decided that they would not want chest compressions if her
pressure fell further. When her blood pressure remained low
164/93 mmHg based on arterial line) with non-palpable pulses, they
decided to withdraw care. She was extubated and pressors were
stopped; she expired soon thereafter.

Family agreed to post-mortem exam.

smile symmetric, tongue midline
no pronator drift
MAE's with 0/5 - No muscle contraction strengths
sensation intact to light touch
incision- well healing, sutures intact

ambulating independently, tolerating PO Diet, pain well
controlled

Pertinent Results:
2025-03-25 Head CT IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No
acute fracture.
2. Large, predominantly CSF-attenuation, cystic lesion with
well-marginated
medial border, centered in the right middle cranial fossa,
likely representing an incidental arachnoid cyst. This process
is unchanged over the ensuing three hours, and associated with
some scalloping of the overlying squamosal temporal bone (3:30),
further proof of its longstanding nature.

2025-03-25 CT Torso: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute traumatic injury.
2. Bilateral lower lobe collapse. Cannot exclude aspiration

2025-03-25 Brain MRI: IMPRESSION:
Large non enhancing intra-axial mass in the right temporal lobe
with local
mass effect. Appearances are consistent with a primary glial
brain tumor.

2025-03-25 Brain CTA:IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearance of the right
temporal lobe mass and associated mass effect. 2. CTA
demonstrates no convincing vascular supply to the right temporal
lobe mass. Major venous sinuses are patent. 3. Possible
arteriovenous malformation in the region of the left MCA
bifurcation. Cerebral angiography is recommended for further
evaluation. 4. Fenestration of the distal A1 segment of the left
anterior cerebral artery.

2025-03-25 Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Preoperative study performed as
requested showing no interval change in the size and extent of
the right temporal lobe tumor with local mass effect and mild
midline shift to the left.

2025-03-25 Head CT: IMPRESSION: Status post right craniotomy and
right temporal lobe mass resection, now with expected
subcutaneous gas and pneumocephalus; small focus of dense
material may represent blood, but no large intraparenchymal or
extra-axial hemorrhage.

2025-03-25 Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes of right
temporal craniotomy without evidence of acute infarct, increase
in mass effect or hydrocephalus. Expected post-surgical changes
with blood products in the surgical cavity and pneumocephalus as
well as soft tissue swelling are identified in the surgical
region. Blood products at the surgical site are from
postoperative change.

Brief Hospital Course:
2025-01-17 He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) service; his complex facial
lacerations were irrigated and suture repaired in the ED.
Neurosurgery consultation was obtained for the right mid cranial
fossa measuring 5.6 X 3.6 lesion. He was started on Dilantin for
seizure prophylaxis. He was cleared from a trauma standpoint and
was transfered to the neurosurgery service for further care.
Final plastics recommendations included keflex for 1 week,
peridex mouthwash three times daily and to follow up in clinic
for suture removal on 2025-07-07.

2025-07-15 Transfered to neurosurgery service. CTA/CTV of the head
was obtained to evaluate the blood supply of his R temporal
tumor prior to his surgery on 2025-06-06. His pain medications were
increased to every 3 hours as he continued to have some facial
and rib pain,though his CT chest was negative for fracture.
Viscous lidocaine mouthwash was also added to help control his
mouth pain. In a family discussion with the patient and his
parents it was decided to undergo elective craniotomy for
resection and biopsy on 2025-06-17.
The neuro-oncology team was consulted for further managment of
his lesion. The neuro-opthamology team was also consulted to
obtain formal visual field testing given the location of his
tumor and the risk of visual field deficit post operatively.
On 2025-05-21 pt underwent MRI head with WAND study for pre-operative
planning. He was kept NPO at midnight and placed on IVF for
hydration. On 2025-08-02 he underwent a right temporal craniotomy for
evacuation and biopsy of his temporal lesion. Post operatively
he was transfered to the ICU for strict blood pressure control
and q1 neuro checks. A post operative head ct showed stable post
operative changes.
He remained stable overnight and was cleared for transfer to the
floor on 2025-04-08. A routine post operative MRI was done which
revealed good tumor resection and no hemorrhage or infarct. PO
diet was advanced and SQ heparin was initiated.
On 2025-04-21 physical therapy was consulted for discharge planning.
He was started on Metoprolol BID for persistant elevated blood
pressure and thorazine for hiccups. Pain was adequately
controlled.
On 2025-05-22 systolic blood pressure was noted to be under much
better control 120-130. He was ambulating independently and pain
was well controlled. He was cleared at this time for discharge
home. He will follow up in the Silver Oaks Nursing Home once he has obtained
insurance and will follow up with his PCP for following of his
blood pressure. We will see him in approximately 1 week for
suture removal.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
WOUND CARE:
â¢You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and
report any of the following problems to your physician.
â¢Keep your incision clean and dry.
â¢You may wash your hair with a mild shampoo 24 hours after your
sutures are removed.
â¢Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your
incision.
â¢DO NOT DRIVE until you are seen at the first follow up
appointment.
â¢Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your
physician.

DIET
Usually no special diet is prescribed after a craniotomy. A
normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you
should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating
before your surgery. Be sure however, to remain well hydrated,
and increase your consumption of fiber, as pain medications may
cause constipation.

MEDICATIONS:
â¢Take all of your medications as ordered. You do not have to
take pain medication unless it is needed. It is important that
you are able to cough, breathe deeply, and is comfortable enough
to walk.
â¢Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication.
â¢Medications that may be prescribed include:
oNarcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone).
oAn over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or
Docusate). If you become constipated, try products such as
Dulcolax, Milk of Magnesia, first, and then Magnesium Citrate or
Fleets enema if needed). Often times, pain medication and
anesthesia can cause constipation.
â¢If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for
anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with
laboratory blood drawing in one week. This can be drawn at your
PCPâs office, but please have the results faxed to +91-827-1294645.
If you have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will
not require blood work monitoring.
â¢Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and
Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding.
â¢If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure
you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec,
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach
irritation. Make sure to take your steroid medication with
meals, or a glass of milk.

ACTIVITY:
The first few weeks after you are discharged you may feel tired
or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger
every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take
to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself
again. In general:
â¢Follow the activity instructions given to you by your doctor
and therapist.
â¢Increase your activity slowly; do not do too much because you
are feeling good.
â¢You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.
â¢If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing
activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and
begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
â¢DO NOT DRIVE until you speak with your physician.
â¢Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your
physician.
â¢Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and
push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy
objects, or straining at stool.
â¢Do your breathing exercises every two hours.
â¢Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour, that you
are awake.

Followup Instructions:
Return to the emergency room immediately if fever exceeds 101Â°F."

Chief Complaint:
""I've been dealing with a lot of depression""

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. Stephanie Schmidt is a 2001 M with a PMH of type-2 diabetes (on
insulin) and a PPHx of ADD with no prior psychiatric
hospitalizations or suicide attempts, who was BIBA this am after
taking 11 Wellbutrin tablets. The pt states that he took
about 12 Wellbutrin pills this morning after a fight with his
girlfriend at 6am. Pt says he took the pills because he wanted
to, ""sleep for a long time."" He thought the pills might, ""make
him sick,"" ""like to the stomach."" After taking them he googled
the potential effects, got scared about the risk of seizures,
and called an ambulance. He says, ""I don't think I was trying to
hurt myself, but I don't know."" He describes taking the pills as
a ""spur of the moment decision."" He denies planning in advance
or writing a note. He describes the fight with his girlfriend
this am as, ""nothing crazy."" He says they frequently argue about
finances and she was upset because he had a friend over last
night.
.
He was prescribed the Wellbutrin on 2025-03-20 by a new PCP. He said
his girlfriend has encouraged him to see a doctor for his
increasing depression, so he made the appointment. He wanted to
see a psychiatrist, and his new PCP gave him Dr. Sanjay Kumar (Obstetrician) number to call,
which he did, but he has not received a call back yet.
.
Pt has been feeling increasing depression for months. He says,
""anything upsets me,"" and describes feeling more sad and easily
angered than usual. He describes feelings of hopelessness,
worthlessness, guilt, decreased sleep, fatigue, anhedonia,
decreased motivation, decreased concentration and memory
changes. He says he has trouble focusing. His girlfriend will
ask him to do the laundry and he will start it, but he won't
remember to finish it. He also endorses racing thoughts,
distractibility, and some impulsivity (I sometimes sell all of
my things, then buy them all back, then sell them again). He
denies risky behavior or an increase in goal-directed behavior.
Pt denies AH/VH/IOR/paranoia.
.
.
.
Collateral:
Girlfriend, Elizabeth Thompson (+919736592915)
On phone this am states that pt has been very depressed lately.
She believes that he has been hesitant to get help because he
has a lot of pride in being able to handle things on his own.
She has been encouraging him to get help and see a doctor, which
he finally did last week. For her the events of the am were, ""a
total shocker."" She does not believe that he was trying to kill
himself and is still not worried that he would do that. Nothing
like this has happened before over the course of their 19 year
relationship. She does have concerns about his depression, which
she think has been steadily increasing since he left his last
job. She says, ""his ADD effects his life everyday, it keeps him
from being an adult.""
.
-OMR note from Dr. Amy Hill:
Pt presented to PCP with increasing depression. He denied SI/HI
at that appointment, but PHQ-9 was 22.
Excerpt from note:
""- ADD -- patient reports being diagnosed and treated for ADD as
a child, and is hoping to be tested and potentially treated
again. He reports difficulty remember things at work and at home
and is peturbed by this.
- Depression -- reports that his depression has been bad
recently given his struggles with caring for his sick son and
being out of work. Denies any history of SI/HI but does say that
he snaps at people and ""always wakes up on the wrong side of the
bed."" He thinks he has taken Zoloft in the past and is willing
to try pharmacotherapy and talk therapy again.""
Pt was started on Wellbutrin, referred to SW and referred to
cognitive Rheumatology clinic for evaluation of ADD.
.
.
.
On interview pt confirmed hx documented in the initial
psychiatric note. Mr. Stephanie Schmidt stated that he has been noticing
increase of depression x last year in the context of loosing
job, having financial stress, having poor day structure.

He reported feeling low mood, feeling sensitive (""everything
upsets me""), feeling helpless/hopeless, worthless, fatigued. He
reports problems with sleep (initial insomnia over one hour),
decreased motivation to do anything during the day. He also
reports increased anxiety, racing thoughts, increased problems
with focus. He admits that he had more conflicts with gf. In
fact, gf called police on him in the context of ""yelling match"".
Now, he has to appear in court. He took pills after an argument
with his girlfriend on 2025-03-20 in an attempt to sleep or
possibly make himself sleep. He is equivocal about whether this
was an attempt to hurt himself. He denies planning ahead and
states that he regretted taking the medication after he read
that he could have a seizure. He told his gf and called EMS 911
immediately after learning the possible effects of the
medication.

Brief Hospital Course:
LEGAL & SAFETY: On admission, the patient signed a conditional
voluntary agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level
throughout their admission. They were also placed on 15 minute
checks status on admission and remained on that level of
observation throughout while being unit restricted. Mr. Stephanie Schmidt
requested to be discharged. He signed three day notice that was
expiring on 2025-03-20. While being cooperative with assessments
and treatments, he continued to insist on discharge on 2025-03-20.

PSYCHIATRIC:
Mr. Stephanie Schmidt was BIBA to the Seoul National University Hospital ED (self-dialed) after
ingestion of 32 Wellbutrin pills after a fight with his
girlfriend. He endorses this was impulsive though acknowledges
acute (months) on chronic (years) of insomnia (falling asleep
and staying asleep), fatigue, anhedonia, amotivation, difficulty
with concentration, self reported memory problems, hopelessness,
and feelings of guilt. He denies suicidal ideation, intent or
plan on admission to the unit but continues to endorse
depressive symptoms. Cognitive and mental status exam was
notable for limitations in attention, executive function, and
recent memory. He demonstrated psychomotor agitation, poor eye
contact, circumstantial thought process, distractibility,
repetitiveness, and mild lability of affect.

Symptoms were Intermittent suggestive of major depressive disorder given
duration, impairment in functioning, and multiple depressive
symptoms (hopelessness, guilt, insomnia, anhedonia, irritable
mood) in the setting of an impulsive act concerning for
purposeful self-injury/death. Furthermore, deficits on cognitive
and mental status exam were concerning for neurodevelopmental
disorder (r/o intellectual disability), frontal lobe
impairment/dysexecutive syndrome and/or attention deficit
disorder. Patient completed up to Moderate grade of school, has bouts
of anger, and impulsivity, and has had difficulty holding jobs.
He reports previous diagnosis of ADD and received treatment with
concerta and clonidine in the past. Differential diagnosis
includes unspecified anxiety disorder given racing thoughts
interfering with sleep and concentration.

We restarted Wellbutrin at a decreased dose of 100mg in the AM.
To address issues of insomnia, frequent awakening and
impulsivity, pt and inpt team, we agreed to initiate treatment
with clonidine 0.05 po qHS. Dose was up-titrated to 0.1mg which
patient tolerated well without report of lightheadedness. We
initiated treatment with sertraline 25mg for anxiety. We
provided daily motivational interviewing and
psychopharmacological evaluation. We coordinated with outpatient
providers to establish care after discharge. We initiated
referral to neuropsychological testing at Michelle Jones to assist with
clarification of diagnosis. We provided daily occupational
therapy led groups which patient participated initially.

Mr. Stephanie Schmidt reported improvement in sleep quality and decrease
in irritability with medication adjustments. He endorsed
resolution of hopelessness and suicidal ideation prior to
discharge. Mental status exam on discharge was notable for an
""okay"" mood congruent with a euthymic, full, reactive,
appropriate affect. Thought process was circumstantial,
repetitive, and distractible at times with fair insight and fair
judgment.

Future interventions include Surgical of neuropsychological
testing and medication initiation to assist with deficits in
concentration, attention, and impulsivity. Patient will benefit
from regular follow up with psychiatric medication prescribers
for dose adjustment.

SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#Tobacco use disorder. 32 packs a day. Discussed smoking
cessation and provided NRT. Provided NRT on discharge. Follow up
appointment with PCP for tobacco use counseling and medication.

with Andrea Velasquez increased to 46. Patient's glucose has
continued to fluctuate Renal Failure due to Chronic Kidney Disease poor dietary choices. Patient to
follow up with Midwife Kavita Nair for continued adjustment after discharge.
Patient was followed by Neurosurgery Unit clinic consult.

PSYCHOSOCIAL
#GROUPS/MILIEU: The patient was encouraged to participate in the
various groups and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the
unit. The patient occasionally attended these groups that
focused on teaching patients various coping skills. Mr. Stephanie Schmidt
was polite, appropriate, and interactive with peers and staff
while on the unit.

#COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Mr. Stephanie Schmidt was not interested in collateral contact with his
Grandmother who was a source of support in his life. He states
that she recently got of the hospital and he does not ""want to
worry her.""

#INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Zoloft 25, clonidine 0.1, Wellbutrin 100
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: PCP, Trinity Heart & Rehab,
psychiatry Trinity Heart & Rehab.

ON 2025-03-20, Mr. Stephanie Schmidt continued to ask to be discharged. He clearly
denied S/H/I. He said that he would be able to return to the
Emergency room if he feels unsafe. He denied A/V/H. He is in
agreement to attend partial hospital program.
When educated about elevated blood glucose, he still was asking
to be discharged. He said he has been dealing with diabetes for
many years. He would like to be followed in the Lakeside Restorative Center.
After repeating pt's labs (CMP, CBC, Blood glucose) and after
being evaluated by Hematology consult, pt was discharged home.
Though patient could have benefitted from longer hospital
treatment, there were no legal grounds to extend inpatient
treatment.
After weighing out risks and benefits, we agreed to proceed with
discharge on 2025-05-28.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS On presentation, the patient was
evaluated and felt to be at an increased risk of harm to himself
based upon acute worsening of depressive symptoms with feelings
of hopelessness in setting of psychosocial stressors. His static
factors noted at that time include history of abuse, chronic
mental illness, chronic medical illness. The modifiable risk
factors were also addressed at that time: lack of engagement
with outpatient treatment, hopelessness, limited coping skills,
no established outpatient treatment, insomnia, lack of purpose.
We provided initiation of medications which assisted with
insomnia and irritability and coordinated with outpatient
providers for ongoing treatment and continued clarification of
diagnosis (neuropsych. testing). Finally, the patient is being
discharged with many protective risk factors; help-seeking
nature, future-oriented viewpoint, sense of responsibility to
family, children in the home, life satisfaction, lack of
suicidal ideation, no history of substance use disorder, strong
social supports. Overall, based on the totality of our
assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Turner is a 2001 year-old woman with h/o bilateral BKA Respiratory Failure
MRSA osteomyelitis and foot ulcers, seizure disorder presenting
with two months of a non-healing ulcer on her right hand.
Patient hit her hand against her wheelchair break handle 2025-02-07 2025-01-28, which caused a laceration on her right hand. The
laceration was repaired at an OSH ED. The patient later
developed an abscess. Patient was cared for by Dr. Nathan Potter
took the patient to the OR three times for debridement and a
wound VAC. Pt removed the wound vac after 2 days because she did
not want to leave it including place. Patient has required
hospitalization for IV antibiotics after debridements and has
been treated with ertapenem and cipro, and minocyclin per
patient.
.
On 2025-04-09 she was seen including the ED and was evaluated by hand
surgery, who recommended MRI. Patient left AMA before MRI was
obtained. Has not taken antibiotics since 2 weeks ago, but
states she has been performing wet to dry since previous
presentation. Yesterday, she re-presented and was going to be
admitted, but again she left AMA. She was sent home on cipro.
She returned to the ED this morning complaining of
nausea/vomiting. Pt reports pain is not currently controlled,
10/10 (worst imaginable pain) 6/10 (moderate-severe) severity, worse at radial aspect of wrist.
Motrin/tylenol has provided no relief. Pt was previously taking
percocet for pain with some relief but no longer has a
prescription. Additionally, pt states she has a tear including a
ligament including her R thumb that was never repaired, and reports
decreased ROM of R thumb. She reports purulent discharge from
area, though this has resolved including the past week. She reports
subjective fevers and chills at home.

PATHOLOGY:
DIAGNOSIS:
Bone, right hand, biopsy (A):
1.  Bone with extensive reparative/regenerative changes.
2.  No significant acute inflammation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Turner yo female with 2 month history of right wrist infection with
multiple debridements, admitted for osteomyelitis and chronic
pain.
.
# Osteomyelitis: Pt has 2 month history of R wrist wound, has
had multiple debridements at other hospitals with questions of
compliance including the past. She presented with MRI concerning for
osteomyelitis. Pt underwent debridement on 2025-02-18 and had wound
VAC placed to right wrist wound. On 2025-02-18 she underwent further
debridement as well as a metacarpophalangeal joint
capsulorrhaphy and a wound vac dressing was placed. On 2025-02-18,
patient had skin graft placed to her right wrist wound (from a
left thigh donor site) and wound vac dressing was placed over
this for constant pressure to graft. This was left including place
until 2025-04-09 when the vac dressing was removed to reveal a
beautiful graft site with 100% take. He graft site was
dressed with xeroform dressing and gauze and her wrist was
immediately casted to protect the graft site, and to be
removed including Hand Clinic after 3 weeks. Regarding antibiotic therapy, the
patient was initially started on daptomycin and clindamycin
based on cultures and sensitivities from tissue culture, but was
then changed to ceftriaxone by ID due to a questionable
penicillin allergy. The goal of ceftriaxone therapy is to be 6
weeks. A PICC line was placed to accomodate long term
antibiotic therapy. Patient will be followed closely by ID upon
discharge via weekly outpatient lab work and close outpatient
follow up visits.
.
# pain management: Pt has history of chronic pain, has been
referred to pain clinic including the past at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital but has not kept
any appointments. Based on outside pharmacy records, pt has
filled prescriptions for >500 oxycodone tablets including the past 2
months, mostly prescribed from physician at outside pain clinic.
Her pain has been difficult to control Shaunmouth house. Patient often
threatened to sign out AMA if her pain medications were not
managed and prescribed to her liking. Patient has allergies to
motrin and toradol so these were not options. She often refused
tylenol reporting that it didn't 'work' for her. Ultimately,
patient was managed on a combination of IV morphine and
oxycodone which she reported worked well for her. IV morphine
was discontinued on 2025-04-09 and patient was given oxycondone
10mg q4h PRN which she was requesting every four hours. When
wound vac was taken down over skin graft site and patient was
placed including a cast, Dr. Nathan Potter attempted to encourage patient to
take just tylenol as her pain should be less and less, the
further she gets out from her surgery but she refused stating
she had ""deep bone pain"" including her wrist. She, again, stated that
""tylenol doesn't work for me."" Dr. Nathan Potter explained that
she would be discharged home with a script for oxycodone that
will last for 3 weeks and that she will not be prescribed
anymore oxycodone during these next 3 weeks. Patient verbalized
understanding of this pain management plan. Patient actively
denies having a substance abuse problem even when offered
professional assistance.
.
# seizure disorder: Pt with reported seizure disorder following
trauma many years ago, however on presentation her phenytoin
level was undetectable. We continued her on her reported home
dose of dilantin and monitored levels. At one point, her level
was supratherapeutic, so her dosing was decreased to TID and
then again to BID. When she was discharged, her level was
therapeutic at 13.2. Patient had no seizure activity during her
inpatient stay.
.
# Psych: Patient was evaluated by our psych service including the ER,
upon first arrival (see Psych evaluations including OMR for details).
Patient was also seen by our Social work service to help with
coordination of care for her mother (who lives at home with her
and is disabled) while patient spent an extended stay including the
hospital. Communication with the They mother's social
worker, Alexis White, at Hematology-Oncology, were
initiated as well when coordinating plan of care. They
mother was able to spend time including a skilled nursing facility
during the time that patient was at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital. Both the medicine
attending and Dr. Nathan Potter spoke with They outpatient
psychiatrist Dr. Jillian Martinez MD (+919977790247) who confirmed
that the patient is very dedicated to her mother and has a had a
difficult time caring for herself since her mother returned home
post-stroke. He also confirmed that patient has never had a
formal psychiatric diagnosis. Dr. Nathan Potter advised patient to
make an appointment with Dr. Nathan Potter (+919977790247) who
specializes including working with patients similar to her and who
would likely be able to give the patient a formal psychiatric
diagnosis. She would also continue to see Dr. Nathan Potter, as she
has been including the past. Patient agreed to this plan prior to her
discharge.
.
Patient was discharged home on hospital day #27 with a right
wrist cast including place with digits pink, warm and mobile. No
evidence of digit or forearm swelling. Patient had a patent
left arm PICC line including place. She also had a small left thigh
skin graft donor site with a drying xeroform dressing including place.
She had a foley catheter including place, as well.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms Turner,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital
Port Roytown. You were admitted for an infected right wrist,
with suspicion that the infection has spread to your bone.
Throughout your admission, you had multiple debridements and
wound vac placements by plastic surgery. While on the medicine
service, we managed your pain with IV and oral medications, and
treated your infection with antibiotics. We determined that you
were not likely allergic to cephalosporins, so we gave you an
antibiotic called ceftriaxone.

You went to the OR for debridements of your right wrist wound
and then eventual coverage with a skin graft taken from your
left thigh and were transferred to plastic surgery service.

-You should continue with your IV antibiotic, ceftriaxone, as
prescribed. Infectious Disease will be following you for this
medication and the labs involved. It is very important to
follow up with them and attend all appointments so you are able
to complete you therapy safely.
-Elevate your right arm as much as possible and maintain it including
your cast for the next three weeks, until your follow up including Hand

History of Present Illness:
Suzanne Johnson with history of paranoid schizophrenia being treated at
Cardiology Clinic presents from Bourned with confusion and falls.
Patient was admitted to Endocrinology Clinic on 2025-02-22 for increasing
paranoia and auditory hallucinations. During her stay there, she
has been treated with multiple psychoactive drugs including
clozaril, lorazepam, trazodone, mirtazipine, haldol,
benztropine, and gabapentin. Per Pharmacy recommendation, it appears that
her clozaril was increased to 175mg daily from 100mg on 2025-06-21
and had ativan started on 2025-06-21. On the morning of 2025-07-05, she
noted to have several witnessed falls (no apparent headstrike or
LOC) and confusion and she was brought to the St. Mary's Hospital ED.
In the ED intial vitals were pain 0, T97.5, HR 95, BP 117/72, RR
20 O2 97%RA. Initial exam was notable for AAO to person and
place. Initial labs were notable for WBC of 13.9 with 76%PMN.
Otherwise Chem10, CBC, LFTs, and serum tox were wnl. UA negative
with Utox pending. Head CT and CXR showed no acute process. She
was admitted to medicine for further management.

On the floor, patient can report that she has been treated at
Cardiology Clinic and has been falling today. She states on her own
that she thinks it was due to increased dose of clozaril. She
notes some urinary urgancy, but denies fevers, chills, or
headache. No shortness of breath or cough. No chest pain. No
nausea vomiting or diarrhea. Review of systems is otherwise
unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
=============================
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION
=============================
Suzanne Johnson with a history of paranoid schizophrenia being treated at
Cardiology Clinic who presents with confusion and falls, likely
medication induced.

=============================
ACTIVE ISSUES
=============================
#Confusion & Falls: The patient presented with confusion and
falls in the setting of recent medication changes. She remained
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was not orthostatic.
Infectious workup (UA and CXR) was not concerning for acute
infection. Inpatient Psychiatry evaluated the patient and
recommended restarting the clozapine at 100mg daily, decreasing
cogentin to 0.5mg BID, and stopping the mirtazapine. If
possible, she should have her trazadone and cogentin
discontinued in the future. Her medications were adjusted and
she passed evaluated by Physical Therapy. She was medically
cleared to return to Cardiology Clinic.
.
#Paranoid schizophrenia/Depression: She has a long standing
history of paranoid schizophrenia. She mentioned to ED nurse
that she is 'always suicidal', although denies SI during
admission. Her medications were adjusted as per above by the
Inpatient Psychiatry team and she had a 1:1 sitter for safety.
=============================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=============================
- Patient medically cleared to return to Cardiology Clinic.
- Inpatient psych adjusted her psychiatric medications. She
would benefit from ultimately discontinuing her trazadone and
cogentin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Moon,
You were admitted for diarrhea. Our laboratory studies showed
that you had a bacteria causing your diarrhea called
Campylobacter. We gave you antibiotics for this which you must
also take tomorrow 2025-03-08. This will be your last dose.
Additionally, we stopped metformin on admission as it often
causes diarrhea and stomach aches. Your diabetes is very well
controlled. We discharged you on a lower dose of 500mg twice
daily (from 1000 mg twice daily).
You also were dehydrated and we gave you IV fluids. You
improved. The fluids may have given you a cough but this also
improved.

Your INR was elevated on admission. We held your Coumadin which
we then restarted. Get your INR checked daily at your short term
rehab facility until it is in the appropriate range.

Please follow up with your PCP in the next week.

It was a pleasure to care for you!

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Jasmine Chandler underwent an uncomplicated total vaginal hysterectomy,
I-stop sling, AP colporrhaphy, cystoscopy, and IUD removal for
urinary incontinence and prolapse; see operative report for
details. She had a brief episode of anxiety in the PACU which
responded to intravenous Ativan. She was unable to void
spontaneously so the foley was replaced on postoperative day 1
and she was given training to go home with a foley and leg bag
in place. Otherwise, she had an uncomplicated recovery and was
discharged home on postoperative day #1 in good condition:
ambulating without difficulty, tolerating a regular diet, with
adequate pain control using PO medication, and with instructions
to follow up with Dr. Gregg Hale for foley removal.

Service: PSYCHIATRY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending: Dr. John Smith.

Chief Complaint:
""I'm feeling suicidal.""

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
2003 y/o man with h/o POTS and
bradycardia who had a recent lengthy St. Georgeâs University Hospital 4 admission for
depression and suicidal ideation treated with ECT, self-presents
to the Gastroenterology Division with thoughts of killing himself by overdosing on
pills.

Mr. Carter has had multiple past psychiatric hopsitalizations
for suicidal ideation and one past suicide attempt by stabbing
himself in the heart.

Although there is no discharge summary available in OMR from his
recent inpatient psychiatric hospitalization on 2025-02-28, Dr.
Michael Martin from Green Valley Hospital indicates that the patient's
hospitalization was for an ""apparent acute exacerbation of
chronic, fairly severe depression, likely related both to an
endogenous depression and to characterologic features that have
contributed as much as anything to his current social isolation,
poor frustration tolerance, and generalized demoralization.""

The patient reported tolerating ECT well, had improved mood with
ECT, and was feeling more ""optimistic"" upon his recent
St. Georgeâs University Hospital 4 discharge. However, Mr. Carter reports not being able to
follow through with the outpatient plan for maintenance ECT due
to complications with his POTS causing transportation
difficulties.

Mr. Carter has had multiple recent presentations to the Green Valley Hospital
emergency department with negative cardiac workups. The patient
reports being angry with Ian Bradley and believes that they are not
providing him with proper medical care.

On presentation to the ED, the paitent reported walking up and
down Michaelberg for a couple hours prior to entering the
ED.
He reports trying to find some way to resolve his feelings of
hopelessness; however, when the urge to kill himself scared him,
he finally made the decision to self-present for psychiatric
evaluation.

The patient reports active suicidality with a plan to overdose
on
his home medications. He says there is no safe outpatient plan.
He reports that he has plenty of pills at home that he could
overdose. He denies access to firearms but does report having
knives similar to the one he stabbed himself with in a past
suicide attempt.

On ROS, the patient reports poor mood, +guilt about not being
able to see his children often, +racing thoughts, +chronic
insomnia (11 hours per night at baseline). He denies changes in
his concentration, appetite, or weight. He is equivocal about
whether or not he has anhedonia.

His main protective factor is reportedly his children.

He denies history of manic symptoms.

He denies symptoms of psychosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Psychiatric: Mr. Carter was admitted to the inpatient
psychiatric service on Tuesday on 2025-07-25. He settled into
the milieu uneventfully. At his initial meeting with his care
team, he was tearful and depressed, discussing his recent
thoughts of suicide following his multiple medical admissions
for symptoms of POTS, since being discharged from Royal Free Hospital
three weeks prior. The team spoke with his outpatient
psychiatrist Dr. Michael Martin provided the collateral
information that Mr. Carter had been on a great variety of
anti-depressant regimens in the past with little to no effect on
his mood. Dr. Liu that the only major improvmement he
had ever seen in the patient's depression and suicidality
occured after his recent course of ECT. The team then contacted
Dr. Michael Martin an ECT consultation. He was evaluated by
medicine and anesthesia and found to be low-risk for this
treatment modality. He started his first session of ECT on
2025-01-28 and had a total of 5 sessions while in house. The team
also opted to augment his medical antidepressant therapy of
wellbutrin SR with abilify. His abilify dose was titrated up
throughout his admission. When his abilify dose reached 20 mg,
he began to experience some akathisia. His dose was then
decreased to 15 mg, he he tolerated this well. He frequently
spent time in the common areas of the psychiatric unit and
attended groups regularly with good particpation. The team
worked with Mr. Carter to find individuals who might be able
to help him to complete ECT as an outpatient, but he was not
able to identify anyone. He ultimately decided that he would be
willing to pay someone to bring him to and from ECT. He could
then be observed at home by a friend, who was free during the
day but who was unable to drive. By the time of discharge, his
mood had brigthened and he was no longer have suicidal thoughts.
The team spoke with his outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. Liu, and his outpatient PCP, Shelby Young, to update them on his progress
and discharge plan. Dr. Liu ECT Patient agreed, and
the inpatient team agreed that he would be discharged home on
2025-05-16 to follow up at the Green Valley Hospital the following Saturday to
begin maintenance therapy. He would receive one session per week
for four weeks, and then would move to one session every 2
weeks. He was scheduled to see his Psychiatrist and PCP within 6
week of discharge. When he left the unit, he was
future-oriented, looking forward to seeing his kids at his son's
football game this weekend and returning to work. He voiced
strategies to cope with future suicidal thoughts, including
distracting himself with work or TV, reaching out to a friend,
or contacting one of his care providers if necessary.

Medical: Mr. Carter was continued on his outpatient midodrine
and pindolol for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome while
on the unit. He experienced intermittent light-headedness, but
had no syncopal episodes. His blood pressure was consistently
within the normal range. The team scheduled an apppointment for
him at the Green Valley Hospital Clinics for early
January. The clinic was hopeful that they could fit him into a
cancellation spot before that time. The team also made him a
follow up appointment with his PCP Shelby Young for the week
after discharge.

Legal: POA
Safety: Mr. Carter was maintained on q 15 minute checks and
did not have any behavioral triggers during his stay.

Group/Milieu: Over the course of his admission, the patient
participated well in groups. It was recommended to him that he
attend an outpatient interpersonal/psychodynamic group to
address his ongoing pattern of difficulty within relationships,
something that contributes to his depression and suicidal
thoughts. He was provided with the phone numbers of several
groups at Green Valley Hospital that may meet his needs. He agreed to consider
contacting them for an interview.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CT Abd/Pel 2025-05-22
1. Re- demonstration of gastric pyloric soft tissue mass with
gastric outlet obstruction. Overall, the degree of gastric
dilatation has worsened.
2. New distal esophageal mucosal hyper enhancement and wall
thickening, likely due to recent vomiting.
3. 15 x 17 mm right interpolar renal lesion, grossly unchanged, more
completely characterized on previous MRI.

CT Abd/Pel 2025-05-22
1. Findings worrisome for afferent limb closed loop obstruction
in a patient who is status post partial gastrectomy with
gastrojejunostomy. Transition point at gastrojejunostomy.
Small amount of free fluid. Preserved mucosal hyperenhancement.
No pneumatosis.
2. Distended stomach and esophagus with oral contrast may
reflect gastric outlet obstruction, also at the
gastrojejunostomy.
3. Percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube in appropriate position,
extending into the collapsed efferent (enteric) limb.
4. Stable intermediate density 1.5 cm left renal lesion,
incompletely
characterized.

ECHO 2025-01-26
Suboptimal study. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with normal
regional and low normal global left ventricular systolic
function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
definite valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.

CT Torso 2025-02-15
1. At least 3 distinct sites worrisome for necrotic small bowel
with loss of bowel wall enhancement. The involved areas include
the new afferent limb (duodenojejunostomy) and small bowel
within the lower pelvis bilaterally.
2. New focal hypodensities scattered throughout the liver are
worrisome for hepatic abscesses with ill-defined hypodensity
within the left hepatic lobe possibly representing postsurgical
change.
3. Heterogeneous 2.7 cm collection within gallbladder fossa
with drain may represent phlegmon or postsurgical change. No
drainable collection.
4. Increased small volume ascites.
5. Diffuse anasarca.

CT Abdomen/Pel 2025-02-11
1. Persistent hypoenhancement of multiple loops of small and
large bowel, including the proximal afferent limb as well as the
distal ascending and proximal transverse colon, as above.
Findings concerning for small bowel and colonic ischemia.
2. Uniform enhancement of the peritoneum most apparent in the
pelvis is concerning for peritonitis.
3. Stable JP drain location surrounding the proximal efferent
limb. Stable location of enteric and gastrojejunostomy tubes.
4. Stable heterogeneity of the liver, primarily affecting the
left hepatic
lobe. While some of these areas, particularly near segments II and 74840
reflect retraction injury in the setting of recent
surgery, more medial hypodensities abutting the region of the
gallbladder fossa collection may represent developing abscess.
5. Persistent small volume ascites. Diffuse anasarca.
6. Unchanged 2.5 x 2.4 cm heterogeneous, phlegmonous appearing
collection in gallbladder fossa.
7. Unchanged mild central and left intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilation.
8. Stable small to moderate left and small right layering
pleural effusions with adjacent bilateral lower lobe relaxation
atelectasis.

Upper extremity venous duplex 2025-02-16
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the bilateral upper
extremity veins. The bilateral jugular veins could not be
accessed on today's exam and were not evaluated.

CT abd/pel 2025-05-22
1. Little change from 2025-05-27. No new or organized
fluid
collection.
2. Continued hypoenhancement or nonenhancement of distal
ascending and
proximal transverse colon is concerning for colonic ischemia or
infarction. Adjacent fluid in the right hemi abdomen contains 2
JP drains. Small pneumoperitoneum in the right hemi abdomen has
increased since 2025-05-27. Peritoneal enhancement suggest
peritonitis.
3. Stable heterogeneity of the liver, predominantly in the left
hepatic lobe. Some areas may represent retraction injury in the
setting of recent surgery.
4. No fluid collection within the gallbladder fossa.
5. Anasarca with small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent
compressive atelectasis, small intra-abdominal ascites and
diffuse body wall edema.
6. 2.0 cm right renal mass is better characterized on MR 2025-06-03.

2025-02-15 CT TORSO:
IMPRESSION:
1. Enteric contrast extravasation in the right subhepatic
abdomen, in the
region of prior air and fluid collection containing 2 JP drains,
with enteric contrast infiltrating the overlying subcutaneous
soft tissue and wound vac dressing compatible with a cutaneous
fistula. Suspected sites are the hepatic flexure and adjacent
small bowel however the exact site is difficult to determine
given the presence of oral contrast simultaneously within the
upper and lower GI tracts.
2. Persistent abnormal appearance of the hepatic flexure and
proximal
transverse colon with thickened hypoenhancing walls, again
thought to be
related to ischemia.
3. Abnormal bowel wall thickening and mucosal hyper enhancement
primarily
involving the biliary limb with mesenteric stranding, peritoneal
enhancement and free fluid likely due to ongoing reactive
inflammation and peritonitis.
4. Diffuse anasarca with moderate bilateral pleural effusions
and small to
moderate amount of abdominal free fluid. No new fluid
collection otherwise identified.
5. Unchanged suspected right renal cell carcinoma.
6. Heterogeneous hypodensity within the left lobe of the liver
is somewhat
improved, again thought to relate to retraction
injury/postoperative changes.

2025-04-24 CARDIAC ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

2025-05-20 G/J-TUBE CHECK:
IMPRESSION:
1. Substantial leak from the jejunum distal to the terminal end
of the GJ
tube.
2. Probable fistulous connection between the transverse colon
and small bowel at the site of afferent limb anastomosis.
3. Mild reflux of contrast into the afferent limb.

2025-06-07 CXR:
IMPRESSION:
A left-sided PICC line is visualized. The course of the line is
unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the lower SVC.
The right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed in the
interval. No pneumothorax. The tracheostomy tube is in
unchanged position. Unchanged appearance of the heart and the
lung parenchyma.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Vanessa Khan was admitted to the Apollo Medical Center surgery service
after presenting with worsening nausea/vomiting. CT abd/pelvis
was obtained on admission (2025-07-21) which showed worsening gastric
outlet obstruction with a greater degree of gastric dilatation
compared to prior imaging. NGT was placed for gastric
decompression. PICC line was placed for TPN. The decision was
subsequntly made with the patient and her family for surgical
resection of her pyloric mass.

She presented to the pre-op holding area on 2025-03-27 for a planned
distal gastrectomy. Her intraoperative course was unremarkable
and she underwent a distal gastrectomy, resection of
peripancreatic lymph node, pedicle falciform flap for protection
of pancreatic node excision site, placement of gold fiducials
for possible CyberKnife, and placement of gastrojejunostomy rube
for stomach drainage and tube feeds. Please see the operative
report for details regarding the operation. Pathology report
showed a 4.5 cm pT4aN1Mx invasive adenocarcinoma. She was
transferred to the surgical floor after a brief uneventful PACU
stay.

On POD5 the patient developed worsening SOB with destauration
with O2 sats in the (75, 89) and tachycardia in the setting of
intolerance to G-tube clamping with nausea and vomiting. On
arrival to the surgical ICU, the patient was found to be in afib
with RVR, HR 170s. She was subsequently given 150mg of
amiodarone x1 for hemodynamic instability and her rhythm was
normalized on a esmolol gtt. Neo was subsequently started for
hypotension. On exam she was found to have diffusely tender
abdomen with pertioneal signs. AST/ALT were elevated to
1117/AST 50 U/L with Tbili elevation to 3.6. CT abdomen and pelvis was
obtained which showed evidence of an afferent limb closed loop
obstruction.

Patient was taken to the OR for emergent exploratory laparotomy
on 2025-08-12. She ultimately underwent a resection of afferent limb
including proximal jejunum and near complete duodenectomy,
roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy (hand sewn), and cholecystectomy.
Please see Dr. Kenneth Edwards report for details regarding
the operation. She was taken to the SICU post-operatively
intubated and on pressors x3 (norepi, neo, and vasopressin).
Given her severe lactic acidosis of 9.7, pH of 7.1 with bicarb
of 13, and no improvement in pH after receiving several amps of
Bicarb, patient was placed on CVVH from 2025-04-05.

CT abdomen/pelvis was repeated on 2025-02-11 showing 3 distinct areas
worrisome for necrotic small bowel. Given downtrending WBC and
benign exam, the decision was made for watchful waiting and
resusitation. Given bloodly output from JP drain, patient
underwent a CTA on 2025-02-03 concerning for small bowel and colonic
ischemia. Patient continued to remain stable hemodynamically.
However, becuase she was unable to wean from ventilatory
support, she underwent tracheostomy placement on 2025-02-24. Tube
feeds were started on 2025-06-07, however she became febrile with
purulent drainage from her JP drains. Tube feeds were
subsequently stopped and she was resumed on TPN. On 2025-04-18, her
midline abdominal incision began to dehisce with purulent stool
drainage. a wound VAC with Malecot was therefore fashioned to
control her enterocutaneous fistula. It was deemed that Ms.
Vanessa Khan was not surgical candidate and multiple family meetings
were held to discuss treatment options. The patient was continue
to be managed conservatively. The patient underwent GJ tube
study on 2025-01-21 secondary to high wound VAC output. Study
demonstrated multiple cutaneuos fistulas. On 2025-01-22 patient was
taken back in OR, she underwent wound exploration and
debridement and wound VAC placement. Post operatively patient
continued to be managed by ICU team. She continued to require
intermittent pressors support to keep her MAP > 65, daily wound
VAC change. Her right JP drain was removed on 2025-01-29, site was
sutured to prevent leak. On 2025-07-30, patient spiked fever, she was
started on Vanc/Cefepime, pan-cultured and ID was called for
consult. Patient's PICC was removed and temporary IJ was placed.
PICC line cultures were positive for VRE and Vancomycin was
changed to Daptomycin. Patient was continued on Ceftriaxone
secondary to positive bronchial lavage cultures. Patient
received total 14 days of Dapto, her following blood cultures
were negative. On 2025-07-17, patient's wound VAC was replaced to
ostomy appliance.

Systems-based Review:

Neurologic:
Patient was given appropriate post-operative pain medication as
needed. At time of discharge patient continued to receive Haldol
prn for agitation, Zyprexa for insomnia and Dilaudid IV with
Fentanyl patch for pain control.

Cardiovascular:
She developed atrial fibrilation with RVR requiring amiodarione
gtt. She was subsequently transitioned to PO amiodarone.
Amiodarone was discontinued secondary to QT prolongations and
intermittent bradycardia. Last ECHO demonstrated LVEF > 55%.

Pulmonary:
Prolonged respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy (2025-02-24). Multiple
SW evaluations for PSM valve failed. Continue to required Vent
support.

GI/Abdomen:
Patient is s/p distal gastrectomy for invasive adenocarcinoma
c/b with afferent limb ischemia requiring takeback and resection
of afferent limb, roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy (hand sewn), and
cholecystectomy, now further complicated by bowel ischemia and
development of enterocutaneous fistula. Patient was started on
octreotide 100 IV q8h and tube feeds have been held given
significant amount of stool drainage from her midline woundvac.
Her midline wound dehiscence and fisula drainage has Well-controlled
controlled with a vac sponge/malecot suction. Wound care consult
was obtained and wound VAC was discontinued. Patient had a wound
appliance placed over her fistula site, malecot catheter was
also removed. Her g-tube remained to have bilious output as
well. Patient continued on TPN.

Nutrition:
TPN was continued due to enteric intolerance.

Renal:
Patient suffered from acute renal failure requiring CVVH from
2025-03-27 to 2025-01-13. Her kidney function has now normalized with now
normal urinary output.

Hematology:
The patient receive 5 units of pRBC for her anemia of chronic
disease. Hct remained low stable.

Infectious Disease:
Multiple potential sources of infection, including urologic
(longstanding foley), pulmonary (trach on vent), and importantly
GI (known GI leak with wound vac with discharge).

Attending: Daniel Lopez.

Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 1992 female with h/o multiple diverticular
bleeds, s/p partial sigmoidectomy with 2025-06-03 takedown
(2025-02-04), subtotal colectomy with side-to-end
ileosigmoid anastomosis (2025-02-04) and two polyps s/p removal, who
presented with one cup of bright red blood per rectum around 3
am (2025-06-21).

Ms. Coleman was at her baseline state of health until developing
some nausea yesterday evening about three hours after dinner.
She vomited food remnants, non-bilious, non-bloody, fell asleep,
and then woke at 3AM with an urge to void and defecate. She
noticed about 1 cup of bright red blood in the bowl, no clots,
no stool. She had no pain at that time, denies associated
symptoms like lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, feeling
weak/fainting, changes in vision. She has not had any diarrhea
or changes in stool habits. She denies any reflux symtoms. She
has not used alcohol, tobacco, NSAIDs, coffee. She drinks an
occasional cup of tea, sometimes peppermint flavored, and some
chocolates.

Of note, she has been hospitalized 10 times since 2025-02-04,
including with BRBPR from Evansfort for diverticular bleed,
when she required 8 units PRBCs, 2 units FFP, 1 unit platelets,
and one related to PUD in 2025-02-04. Many of the others have been in
relation to revision of a AAA (6.7 cm) graft with persistent
endoleak. She was scheduled for an open revision/replacement of
her aortic graft this coming week.

She has had dark stools over the past few weeks that she
attributes to taking iron. She has not felt weak/fatigued -
feels full of energy. Denies recent travel, antibiotics, sick
contacts, or changes in diet.

In the ED, initial VS were 98.0, 71, 113/73, 16, 100 RA. Two
large-bore IVs placed: 16G in R wrist, 18G in R hand. Typed and
screened. Hct was 36.3 and BUN was slightly elevated at 23. CTA
abd/pelvis showed no evidence of aorto-enteric fistula, but did
show multiple diverticuli in leftover colon, and continuing type
2 endoleak.

Vascular surgery saw her in the ED and felt her GIB was highly
unlikely to be related to her AAA history; GI saw her and felt
that since her crit was stable and was not actively bleeding,
she could be admitted for non-urgent scope.

On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling at her baseline
except for a funny taste in her mouth from the oral contrast.
Denies lightheadedness, weakness. She denies abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, and chills.

COLONOSCOPY (2025-05-05):
Previous ileo-colonic anastomosis of the colon
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Polyp in the rectum (polypectomy)

Rectal polyp, polypectomy (2025-01-20):
Hyperplastic polyp.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 1992 female with history of multiple
diverticular bleeds, three suspicious colonic polyps in the last
year (two of which one were adenomas), now s/p subtotal
colectomy with side-to-end ileosigmoid anastomosis (2025-03-03), who
presented with 1 cup of blood per rectum on the morning of
admission.

# Hematochezia: In a woman whose anatomy is so altered (and
colonic surface area and transit time is substantially reduced),
BRBPR could represent either an upper or a lower GI source.
Given that she has a known history of diverticulosis, PUD, and
colonic polyposis, these were foremost on the differential. She
has had significant trouble with diverticulosis in the past,
requiring surgical removal of most of her colon in 2025-02-04 and
2025-02-04. Diverticuli were still present diffusely on the remaining
colon she has by CT; per report, this bleeding was painless and
similar in appearance to her bleeding episodes with
diverticulosis in the past. This was the leading item on our
differential.

She has three known polyps (two were found to be adenomatous)
that have been removed (two by subtotal colectomy, other via
polypectomy). She developed both within a short period of time
-- the two colonoscopies were conducted within the past year.
This could have potentially represented another polyp or
adenoma, though less likely, given known diverticular burden.

With respect to PUD, she had few risk factors by history
(including no NSAIDs, coffee, tobacco, alcohol use) -- she only
drinks a moderate amount of tea. She is also now s/p antibiotic
treatment for H. pylori (2025-06-24), and has reportedly tested
negative for it since then. This was low on our differential.

Aorto-enteric fistula in a patient with a history of an
abdominal aortic aneurysm or an aortic graft should always be
considered. However, this was not seen on the CT. Angiodysplasia
is much rarer, and would be a diagnosis of exclusion here, since
Ms. Coleman has many more pertinent pathological entities that
could account for this. Ischemic, ulcerative colitis not likely
per history; no evidence of anorectal source.

Did not bled again while in the hospital; reassured by stability
of Hct here (see results).

Since she did not rebleed while in-patient, neither GI (who was
following the pt) nor vascular surgery felt that a colonoscopy
with potential intervention would be productive, as the culprit
diverticulum had likely spontaneously stopped bleeding.

While here, we maintain access on the pt with two large-bore
PIVs (R hand, R wrist). She was typed and screened. We monitored
Hct TID. We held her home aspirin, lisinopril, and amlodipine.
She was maintained NPO for 15 hours; once we felt secure that
she was hemodynamically stable, we advanced her to a regular
diet on the morning of discharge. She tolerated this well,
without nausea, vomiting, abd pain, or diarrhea.

# AAA revision:
Planned surgery on 2025-05-27: EXPLANT STENT GRAFT; REPAIR AORTIC
ANEURYSM; RETROPERITONEAL
Pt contacted anesthesia dept regarding hospitalization; they
conducted her scheduled pre-surgical evaluation at the bedside
on 2025-02-04 instead of in the clinic. Still planning for AAA
graft revision next week; vascular surgery aware and following.
Vascular surgery aware and following.

# HCM:
- Held aspirin.
- Continued iron, vit D, B, multivit.

# HTN:
- Held lisinopril, amlodipine in the setting of a GIB in order

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Coleman,

You were admitted to the BI after passing a cup of blood into
your toilet bowl during the night on 2025-07-31. You were monitored
here, and were found to have a stable blood count (hematocrit)
over time, and were not seen to pass further blood through your
rectum while you were here. You were initially maintained
without food or drink by mouth, so as not to aggravate the
bleeding. However, on the morning of 2025-03-18, you were able to
advance your diet without trouble.

We think the primary reason for your bleed was diverticulosis,
from which you have experienced bleeding before. We saw
extensive evidence of diverticuli in your remaining colon on the
CT scan of your abdomen. We think the bleed has resolved on its
own. We touched base with vascular surgery as well as the
gastrointestinal team, and in coordination with them, we decided
that a colonoscopy would not help very much at this stage,
because we would attempt to do anything (such as clipping) to
the diverticuli that you are known to have. We would not be able
to identify which diverticulum the bleed was coming from since
it is no longer bleeding. At this time, we are fairly
comfortable that the bleed has stopped.

This morning, you will proceed with the anesthesia evaluation
for the surgery you have scheduled for next week, and then will
have this procedure as planned.

We made no changes in your medications.

It was a pleasure taking part in your care.

after having bowl of noodles. Pain is sharp and radiates to
back. Associated with nausea and sensation of bloating.She had
one episode of yellow emesis. Last BM and flatus within 24h.

She began to notice this pain, though less in severity, just

Pertinent Results:
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of 2025-03-03 5:48 pm
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse severe dilatation of proximal small bowel with a low
transition point (602B, 30), consistent with high grade small
bowel obstruction. Most likely etiology is adhesions related to
prior hysterectomy. Small ascites.
2. A C-shaped small bowel loop in the low anterior abdomen with
two
converging transition points and interdigitating moderate fluid,
suggests a closed loop component to obstruction. No bowel wall
non-enhancement,
pneumatosis, or perforation.
3. 10 cm segment of small caliber small bowel interposed
between dilated
bowel loops in the mid abdomen with mucosal hyperemia, may
suggest congestion, even early ischemia.
4. Mild mesenteric swirling and rightward shift of the jejunum,
significance uncertain, but raises question of potential
internal hernia, although not diagnostic.
5. Large axial hiatal hernia without obstruction.
6. Subcentimeter hepatic segment VI lesions too small to fully
characterize.
7. Left hemipelvic cortical thickening, sclerosis, and
trabecular coarsening, consistent with Paget's disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Cummings was admitted on 2025-07-12 under the Acute Care Surgical
service for management of her small bowel obstruction. She was
taken urgently to the operating room and underwent laparoscopic
converted to open, adhesiolysis and small-bowel resection (see
operative note by Dr. Jose Houston details). She tolerated the
procedure well and was extubated upon completion and transferred
to the PACU for recovery.

She was subsequently transferred to the surgical floor. She was
kept NPO with an NG tube for decompression and given IV fluids
for hydration. On 2025-07-05 the patient self d/c'd her NG tube. On
2025-02-26 she had evidence of bowel function and was started on a
clear liquid diet, which was slowly advanced as tolerated to a
regular diet. A foley catheter was placed perioperatively for
urine output monitoring. This was removed on 2025-05-06, but was
subsequently reinserted for urinary retention.

She was noted to have hallucinations during her postoperative
course as well as some tachycardia and hypertension. It was
unclear whether the cause of this was narcotics, benzo
withdrawal from her regular home medications (on clonazepam at
home), or if it was related to her history of schizoaffective
disorder. Psychiatry was consulted given her waxing and waning
mental status with concerns about confusion with disorientation.
Her home medications were restarted when tolerating PO's.
Medical work up for causes of delirium was initiated. Her
electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed. Her WBC
trended down to normal and her u/a and urine culture were
negative. ECG showed NSR with no changes. She was started on
metoprolol for hypertension and tachycardia.

On 2025-06-07 some erythema and drainage was noted from the inferior
portion of her surgical incision and a couple staples were
removed to allow drainage. Daily dressing changes were
performed.

She was encouraged to mobilize out of bed and ambulate as
tolerated. Physical therapy was consulted and have recommended
rehab after her acute hospital stay.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a small bowel
obstruction. You were taken to the operating room and underwent
an exploratory laparatomy with lysis of adhesions and a small
bowel resection. You bowel function has returned after the
surgery and you are now being discharged with the following
instructions:

Please follow up in Mercy Health Hospital clinic at the appointment sdcheduled for
you below. Your staples will be removed at this appointment.
ACTIVITY:

Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs.
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than 55 kg lbs for 1:4 weeks. (This is about the
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you
can resume tub baths or swimming.
Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common
sense and go slowly at first.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL:

You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want to
nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your
throat during surgery.
You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You
might feel somewhat depressed.
You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go
away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon.

YOUR INCISION:
Your incision may be slightly red around the staples. This is
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
It is normal to feel a firm ridge along the incision. This will
go away.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining
your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may
resume tub baths or swimming.
Ove the next 1.5:1 months, your incision will fade and become
less prominent.

YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of medicine such as
Percocet or codeine. If needed, you may take a stool softener
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving
the bowels, call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"".
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription from your surgeon for pain
medicine to take by mouth. It is important to take this medicine
as directied. Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do
not take more medicine at one time than prescribed.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your
surgeon has said its okay.
If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of
pain medicine.
Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the folloiwng, please contact your
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
In some cases you will have a prescription for antibiotics or
other medication.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to
take, please call your surgeon.

DANGER SIGNS:
Please call your surgeon if you develop:
- worsening abdominal pain
- sharp or severe pain that lasts several hours
- temperature of 101 degrees or higher
- severe diarrhea
- vomiting
- redness around the incision that is spreading
- increased swelling around the incision
- excessive bruising around the incision
- cloudy fluid coming from the wound
- bright red blood or foul smelling discharge coming from the
wound
- an increase in drainage from the wound

Followup Instructions:
Start the prescribed medication and do not miss any doses."

2025-01-22 - Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Amy Chase retired pathologist with history of HTN, HLD, aortic
stenosis with aortic root dilation who presents from home after
an episode of confusion. Patient reports that he was in his
usual state of health until he woke up this morning and felt a
little chilly with some shivers. He spent most of the day
watching football. Per his family, he had just finished his
supper while watching football when he didn't ""look right"" then
had one episode of emesis. He was sleepier and mildly confused.
They asked if they should call Dermatology and he told them yes (which
is abnormal for him). EMS arrived and brought him to Green Valley Hospital and had
a possible STEMI on EKG. On arrival he was alert and oriented x3
(except he thought it was 2025-03-26) and didn't have any
localizing symptoms. No fever, chills, cough, neck pain,
headache, dysuria/polyuria. No abdominal pain, denied n/v/d.
Family said on arrival to the ED at midnight, the patient looks
much improved, back to baseline mental status but that he was
confused earlier and didn't seem right and seemed warm to the
touch. Slight increase in cough today but always has baseline
cough from post nasal drip. Denies any sick contacts..

Cardiology was consulted in the ED and felt that his EKG looked
improved and the patient was patient was asymptomatic without
any recent chest pain or SOB. Prelim cardiac echo reported to
show no obvious wall motion abnormalities. Fellow felt urgent
cath was not needed and recommended heparin drip and NPO for
cath in AM.

In the ED intial vitals were: 101.1 85 136/41 16 98% RA
Patient was given: ASA 325mg by EMS, CTX, Vanc, atorva 80, and
started on heparin bolus plus drip.
Labs notable for trop 0.34 and Cr 2.
Vitals on transfer: 97.8 86 98/40 18 98% RA
On the floor patient is A&O x3 and feels well without any
specific complains. Again, denies every having chest pain or
SOB.

ROS: On review of systems, denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. Denies recent fevers. Denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
==================
CXR 2025-01-15:
Biapical pleural scarring. Subtle retrocardiac airspace opacity,
best appreciated on the lateral. Trace left pleural effusion
with adjacent atelectasis is noted.

CT HEAD 2025-01-15:
No evidence of acute intracranial process.

TTE 2025-01-15:
LV apex aneurysmal. Mild-moderate regional LV systolic
dysfunction with severe HK of distal septum, ant, and inf walls
with apical aneurysm/akinesis. LVEF = 40%.
IMPRESSION: Normal LV cavity size with regional systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD (mid LAD distribution) vs. Takotsubo
Cardiomyopathy. Thickened aortic valve.

Cath 2025-01-22:
Coronary angiography: right dominant
LMCA: normal
LAD: <50% proximal disease, long segment stenosis to 90% after
D1
LCX: 60% mid lesion
RCA: minor irregularities

LAD lesion crossed with Prowater wire, dilated with 2.0 balloon
and stented with overlapping 2.5x32 (distal) and 2.5x8
(proximal) Premier stents postdilated to 2.75 mm at 16 atm.
Dopamine 5 mcg begun at beginning of procedure for SBP 80,
stopped at end with return to baseline SBP in 01:30 AM.

Assessment & Recommendations
1. Successful drug-eluting stent of LAD
2. Follow cardiac enzymes
3. Review echo for LV function and severity of aortic stenosis
4. Follow renal function
5. Report following procedure of + blood cultures - if true
will need to treat aggressively with antibiotics in view of
stent
placement.

Abdominal Ultrasound 2025-01-15:
Unremarkable abdomen ultrasound with no findings to suggest an
abscess.
The right kidney is noted to be somewhat atrophic with cortical
thinning
suggesting chronic renal disease.

TTE: 2025-01-15
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears mildly-to-moderately
depressed (LVEF = 40%) secondary to apical hypokinesis with
focal apical akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area = 1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (Severe) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-01-14
the findings are similar.

CT Abdomen: 2025-01-15. No specific CT finding in the abdomen or pelvis to explain
the patient's
symptoms.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Non-complicated diverticulosis.
4. Post-surgical pneumobilia.
5. Incidental old compression fractures at T11 and L1.

CXR 2025-01-15:
Right lower lobe consolidation has improved since 2025-07-10,
likely
pneumonia, but moderate right pleural effusion persists. Heart
is normal size and mediastinal vessels are not engorged, but
there is pulmonary vascular redistribution. Pulmonary edema has
not recurred. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Amy Chase is a 1983 with a past medical history of HTN, HLD,
aortic stenosis, aortic root dilation, who presented from home
with fever chills, and confusion x 1 day, dx with STEMI s/p DES
x2, bacteremia, Hypertension and SIADH.

# Polymicrobial bacteremia:
Pt presents with fever, hypotension and elevated lactate,
briefly requiring vasopressor during catheterization. Found to
have e. coli and enterococcus bacteremia. He initially had a
leukocytosis that has since resolved. Zosyn was started for two
week course per ID. S/p midline placement 2025-04-02. Last dose of
Zosyn will be 2025-01-25.

# STEMI: EF 40%. s/p DES to LAD. Has persistent STE Webstertown apical
dyskinesis. No further chest pain.
- Cont Plavix 75mg po daily
- Cont ASA 81mg po daily
- Cont Atorvastatin 80mg po daily
- Continue metoprolol succinate
- Holding ACE-I in setting of creatinine

# Renal Failure due to Chronic Kidney Disease: Cr 2 on presentation without unknown prior baseline.
Throughout hospitalization this stabilized. Pt states it has
always been high but doesn't know the specific number. FeNa
suggests prerenal cause. At the time of discharge the creatinine
was 2.1.
As an outpatient Mr. Amy Chase should have an electrolyte check and
follow up with his PCP. He should also avoid all nephrotoxic
agents and renally dose his medications.

# Hyponatremia: FeNa suggests pt is prerenal although looks
euvolemic on exam. No obvious medication changes that could
contribute. Antibiotics do not have side effect of hyponatremia.
T4/T3 nl. No hypotension to suggest cortisol def. Urine studies
indicate SIADH. Patient was placed on free water restriction
with liberalized diet. Prior to discharge his sodium was 138
# Apical Akinesis: focal apical akinesis on Echo 2025-06-19.
- continue to hold off anticoagulation in setting of recent
guaiac positive stools and ? of GI bleed in ICU. As an
outpatient he should have a follow up echo.

#)paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: rate controlled
-no AC at this time r/t hx GIB
-Pt asked to follow up with his PCP for upper/lower GI scope

# Hypoxia/COPD: resolved. No wheezes on exam.
CXR is improving. Sputum cx neg.
- Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs
- Outpatient PFTs

# Anemia: Mild and stable. Still having heme pos stools.
Haptoglobin nl. Possible gastritis vs lower GIB. Not starting
warfarin at this time but is on ASA/clopidogrel for stent. Will
continue PPI as outpatient.

# Confusion: Resolved, appears clear and oriented.

# Thrombocytopenia: resolving
Baseline not known.
- Trend PLT

# Transaminitis: DDx includes bile duct pathology vs. hepatic
congestion from CHF.
- Trend LFTs
- Abd US as above

Discharge Instructions:
Dr. Amy Chase,
You presented to the hospital with confusion and a fever with
low blood pressure. You were found to have sepsis. You also had
a heart attack, and 2 stents were placed to re-open the blockage
and improve blood flow to your heart. You were started on
Plavix. You were already taking Aspirin. Aspirin and Plavix are
used to decrease at the risk of clot/blockage in your
arteries/stents. You will take Plavix for at least one year, and
Aspirin indefinitely. Do not stop taking Plavix until told to do
so by your Cardiologist. Stopping Plavix prematurely may
increase your risk of a life threatening heart attack.
You also had an acute innjury to your kidneys and a low sodium
level. Both of these problems have resolved, however please
restart your Losartan at half of your home dose.
You will need to take an IV antibiotic through PICC line.
Lastly, you had several self resolving episodes of atrial
fibrillation while you were in the hospital. Out of concern for
some stools that tested positive for blood, you were not started
on any anti-coagulation. It is strongly advised that you have
scopes of your upper and lower GI tracts to determine if there
is any bleeding. Based on those results, a decision can be made
about anti-coagulation.
You have decided that you do not want to go to have home Nursing visits
services, but have instead decided to participate in outpatient
Cardiac Rehabilitation.
It has been a pleasure to participate in your care.
Best Regards,
The CCU Team

Followup Instructions:
Continue physiotherapy sessions 3 times per week for rehabilitation."

and HLD with diagnosis of AML (CEBPA positive) who presents for
scheduled chemotherapy, C25 D8-12 of MUC1 with
Decitabine(Protocol 74141).

ACUTE ISSUES:
------------------

#AML:
#ENCOUNTER FOR CHEMOTHERAPY:
She was admitted for C25 D8-12 of MUC-1 inhibitor and Decitabine
trial per 77270 protocol. Bone marrow on 2025-02-13 showed
no evidence of acute leukemia. Regimen D1 of C25 was delayed due
to HTN exacerbation but was subsequently restarted once
normotensive. She received the MUC-1 inhibitor and Decitabine
trial without complication. He has an appt with her PCP for labs
on 2025-05-29. Melissa Joyce RN to call Hannah Mcconnell after discharge to set up
appt.

#HYPERTENSION: Normotensive on admission. Historically,
hypertension has been exacerbated during prior treatments.
Requires Amlodipine as an inpatient only. She was re-initiated
on amlodipine 7.5mg daily & continues on losartan 100mg daily
with
PRN Hydralazine 25mg PO BID PRN in the setting of sustained SBP
(> 160 prior to receiving MUC-1). She did not require
Hydralazine this admission. Amlodipine was discontinued on
discharge.

#CINV: Intermittent nausea in the evenings. History of nausea
with previous cycles. She continued Ativan and zofran as needed
with good response.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
--------------------

eGFR 75 mL/min/1.73mÂ²: Fluctuated during admission from High. Improved after IVF
boluses. Prior admissions with eGFR 75 mL/min/1.73mÂ² attributed to pre-renal
etiology.

#NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA: MCV 84, could be due to anemia of chronic
disease vs. iron deficiency. Her most recent ferritin is normal
but on the lower range; therefore, she was initiated on ferrous
sulfate as she may be iron deficient. No evidence of acute blood
loss. She continued on ferrous sulfate daily and bowel regimen
PRN.

#ALLERGIES: No acute symptoms on admission. Claritin daily PRN.

#MEMORY LOSS: Noted overall memory issues on prior admissions
with poor historic timeline. Most recent CT head showed atrophy,
probable small vessel ischemic changes, and atherosclerotic
vascular disease which is likely age-related but no other
abnormalities. CTM.

#INFECTIOUS PROPHYLAXIS: Continued acyclovir 400mg BID.

#Transitional Issues: Plan to obtain audiogram outpatient for
monitoring of hearing loss. Rheumatology Specialty Clinic to set up outpatient
follow up.

Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 2011 year old man with a history of diabetes
mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery
disease (catheterization 2025-01-02: LAD 40% stenosis, RCA 50%
stenosis; Echo 2025-06-16 LVEF>=60; RCA angioplasty 2025-07-10 who presents
with chest pain.
.
This AM the patient awoke with substernal chest pressure and
pain (3/10 (moderate)) that radiated to his arms bilaterally. It was
associated with light-headedness and a sensation of a pounding
heartbeat. He notes it felt similar to previous episodes of
chest pain except the pounding sensation was new. He took a
shower, shaved and notified his daughter (who currently lives at
home with him) who prompted him to take his SL nitroglycerin.
Approximately 1 hour after his symptoms started, he took 3 SLNG
separated by 11:37 AM minutes which decreased his symptoms. His
daughter drove him to National University Hospital where an EKG was
reportedly at baseline and a set of cardiac enzymes were
negative. Chest x-ray was read as concerning for left lower lobe
pneumonia and he was given azithromycin and ceftriaxone. He was
then transferred to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre for futher care.
During this episode, he is unsure if he had breathing
difficulty. He had no n/v, diaphoresis.
.
He has a long history of exertional chest pain, which resolves
with rest and/or SLNG. His last episode that he and his wife
recalls was in 2025-03-09. He is usually able to walk ~ 5 meters mile
before having chest discomfort that resolves with sitting down;
at times his chest discomfort requires SLNG. No orthopnea, PND,
lower extremity swelling.
.
No recent cough, or fever/chills. He last had a cough in early
03 that was productive of mucous and associated with chills.
His PCP prescribed him cough suppressants and his symptoms
resolved after ~ 1 week.
.
In the ED, his vitals were 98.3, 60-70s, 128/56, 20, 96%RA. He
was given aspirin. Second set of cardiac enzymes were drawn.

Transthoracic Echocardiography 2025-06-16
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild diastolic LV dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-08-07,
the findings are similar.

Exercise Stress Test 2025-07-15
- Exercise data
Exercise protocol: modified Jennifer Wilson protocol
Resting heart rate: 58
Resting blood pressure: 126/60
Exercise Duration: 9.5 min
Peak heart rate: 115
Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 78%
Peak blood pressure: 174/70
Symptoms during exercise: no anginal type symptoms.
Reason exercise terminated: fatigue
ECG findings: uninterpretable EKG findings due to LBBB.
Good functional exercise capacity. No anginal type symptoms
with uninterpretable ECG to achieved workload. Normal
hemodynamic
response to exercise.
- Cardiac Perfusion
The image quality is adequate.
Left ventricular cavity size is normal (EDV=82ml).
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the
left ventricular myocardium.
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 61%.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal myocardial perfusion study at the level of exercise
achieved.
2. Left ventricle with normal size and normal systolic function.

Chest X-ray 2025-07-12: Gallbladder clips otherwise unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 2011 year old man with a history of diabetes
mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery
disease (catheterization 2025-01-02: LAD 40% stenosis, RCA 50%
stenosis; Echo 2025-06-16 LVEF>=60; RCA angioplasty 2025-07-10 who presents
with chest pain.

1) Chest Pain
Although the patient's symptoms resolved with sublingual
nitroglycerin, his presentation was concerning for unstable
angina as he had had symptoms at rest. EKG showed new T-wave
inversions in the anterior leads. He was treated with aspirin
and started on a heparin drip overnight. In the morning, the
heparin drip was discontinued as he had 3 sets of negative
cardiac enzymes and remained asymptomatic (at rest and with
ambulation). Repeat EKG showed resolving EKG abnormalities.
A modified Jennifer Wilson stress test was completed which showed good
functional exercise capacity without anginal symptoms and normal
hemodynamic response to exercise (EKG was uninterpretable in the
setting of rate-related left bundle branch block); nuclear
perfusion study showed normal myocardial perfusion with normal
left ventricular size and systolic function.
Transthoracic echocardiography showed: normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function; mild diastolic LV
dysfunction; and moderate pulmonary hypertension; compared with
the prior study of 2025-08-07, the findings are similar.
During his stay, the patient remained asymptomatic and
hemodynamically stable. Given the EKG changes, his symptoms were
likely cardiac in origin. Cardiology consult felt no
intervention or catherization was required at this time. The
patient was schedule for a follow-up appointment was this
cardiologist Dr. Jackson.

2) Question of pneumonia
At the outside hospital, staff suspected the patient had a
pneumonia. At Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, the patient had no fever, no cough, and a
normal chest x-ray. Based on this evidence, he was not diagnosed
with pneumonia. He did have a mild leukocytosis with mild
neutrophilia, which could have been due to transient myocardial
ischemia.

3) Coronary artery disease
The patient was continued on metoprolol and ezetimibe. His dose
of aspirin was increased from 81 mg daily to 325 mg daily. His
dose of atorvastatin was increased from 40 mg daily to 80 mg
daily. As described above, an exercise tolerance test was normal
and an echo showed similar findings to those in 2025-08-07.

4) Type 1 mellitus, type II
The patient's HbA1c was 8.4 in 2025-06-04. He was seen by Riverbend Chronic Care
staff to optimize his diabetes regimen. His glyburide dose was
increased from 5 mg twice a day to 10 mg twice a day. His
metformin dose was increased from 500 mg once a day to 1000 mg
twice a day. He was discharged home with visiting nursing to
teach him to check his blood glucose levels on his own. He was
scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Jackson, who
the patient had seen in the past for diabetes.

HPI:
The patient is a 1989 year old female with a long standing
history of Crohn's disease on humira who has chonic RLQ pain and
then developed LUQ over the course of 3 days. Her pain is
worsened by eating and drinking, even drinking water. It is also
worsened by moving. She rates the pain as 10/10 (worst imaginable pain). She has not
had a bm for 2 weeks. She was taking senna, colace, golytely for
two weeks and then she was straining to have a bm today which
made the pain worse, then she had sensation that something in
the LUQ popped and a severe onset of LUQ associated with
dizziness, nausea and blood in toilet. She has been having
vaginal and rectal bleeding for the past three weeks but no
stool until today which was a small amount. When she came out
of the BR her family members asked her to go the ED because she
looked pale. She also felt very weak.
She has been having intermittent vaginal bleeding and stooling
for 3 weeks. +chills and sweats without fevers. She thinks that
she has lost weight but she is not sure. She has been having
occasional blindness in R eye since 2025-05-05 which improves
with special glasses and when she eats sugar. No CP. She has
SOB when she is straining to have a BM. No DOE. + nausea
without overt emesis but she does spit up mucus. + gas/bloating
and distension. No oral ulcers. Urinary urgency without

CXR:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to 2025-05-13:

Lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are
normal.

I see no displaced rib fracture, but conventional chest
radiographs are not
sensitive in finding subtle chest cage trauma. Focal findings
should be
marked for rib detail views.
.
.
CT ABDOMEN:

CT Abdomen: There are small bilateral pleural effusions and
dependent
atelectasis at both lung bases.

The liver enhances homogeneously. There are no focal concerning
liver
lesions. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
The hepatic
and portal veins are patent. Gallbladder is normal. The spleen
has normal
attenuation and enhancement. The pancreas and the spleen
enhance
homogeneously. There is no evidence of splenic infarct. The
kidneys enhance
symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. There is no
ascites or abdominal
adenopathy. The aorta and its major branches are patent. The
stomach and
proximal loops of bowel have normal caliber and appearance.

CT Pelvis: There is moderate wall thickening of the distal
20-25 cm of
terminal ileum (6:20 33). There is mild thin mucosal
hyperenhancement and no
significant intramural hyperenhancemnt or adjacent mesenteric
stranding. No
adenopathy. Although bowel distention is limited by poor
passage or oral
contrast, there is no evidence of stricture or proximal
dilation. There is no
evidence of interloop fistula. The appendix is normal. There is
a small
volume of free pelvic fluid. A left tubal ligation clip is in
appropriate
position. The right tubal ligation clip is positioned
abnormally in the
midline peritoneum, anterior to the uterus and not in the
vicinity proximity
of the right fallopian tube (3: 127).

Radiopaque setons are noted within perianal fistulae which were
previously
assessed with pelvic MRI. The bladder and uterus are
unremarkable.

There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.


IMPRESSION:
1. Chronic disease of the distal 20-25 cm of terminal ileum
with minimal to
mild active disease. No evidence of stricture. No abscess.

2. No splenic infarct, colitis, or other explanation for left
upper quadrant
pain.

3. Right tubal ligation clip appears dislodged and is anterior
to the uterus.
A secondary contraception method may be necessary.

4. Known perianal fistulae with setons.
.
.

FINDINGS:

Approximately 8 mm above the anal verge is a thin fistulous
tract arising from
the lower anal canal at 7 o'clock position (1002:79) coursing
inferiorly along
the intersphincteric plane, opens directly onto the skin in the
right perianal
region. This tract predominantly contains granulation tissue,
and minimal if
any fluid. Approximately a centimeter above the anal verge is a
left-sided
fistulous tract arising at 3 oâclock position o'clock position (1002:82), which
now has a Silicone in place. This fistula continues to have an
intersphincteric course
opening onto the left gluteal skin. The tract is adequately
drained with
fluid. A posterior branching tract from the left perianal
fistula has less
inflammation compared to the prior study and continues to extend
to the left
gluteal skin. No new fistulas are identified, especially no
evidence of a
rectovaginal fistula. There is no evidence of a perirectal
abscess.

The uterus is anteverted and retroflexed. The endometrium is
normal,
measuring 6 mm. A 11 mm T2 hypointense enhancing lesion in the
uterus is
consistent with a fibroid. The ovaries are normal. The imaged
portion of the
rectum is normal. The urinary bladder is normal. There is a
small amount of
pelvic free fluid. Few reactive inguinal lymph nodes are seen
bilaterally. No
marrow signal abnormality is seen. The pelvic vasculature is
widely patent.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right- and left-sided small intersphincteric perianal
fistulas,
demonstrating minimal, if any fluid. The left fistulous tract
containing a
Silicone has decreased inflammation compared to the prior study of
2025-01-09.
2. No new perianal fistulas, especially no evidence of
rectovaginal fistula
or abscess.
.
.
KUB:
FINDINGS:
Supine and upright views of the abdomen. The bowel gas pattern
is normal
without dilated small or large bowel to suggest obstruction. No
air-fluid
level or pneumoperitoneum is seen on the upright view. No
pneumatosis or
portal venous gas. Two metallic densities projecting over the
left hemipelvis
are consistent with tubal ligation clips.
IMPRESSION:
Normal bowel gas pattern without evidence of obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT / PLAN:
1989 year old female with h/o Crohn's on 1994 admitted in Lake Janetbury
admitted with LUQ pain
.
#ABDOMINAL PAIN: The patient's pain was likely due to
constipation versus functional. She had an MRI pelvis that did
not demonstrate new fistula formation or abscess. She had a CT
abdomen that did not demonstrate significant colitis or acute
pathology. CXR did not demonstrate thoracic pathology such as
pneumonia or rib fracture. Her inflammatory markers were
normal. She was afebrile with negative urine and blood cultures.
She reported not having a bowel movement in over ten days. She
was given a bowel regimen of senna/colase/miralax. She was also
given 1 liter of golytely, which was effective in producing
multiple bowel movements resulting in improvement in her
symptoms.

#FREE TUBAL LIGATION CLIP: CT scan demonstrated that the right
tubal ligation clip was likely dislodged. This was discussed
with the patient, including the need for alternative
contraception. She was also scheduled for follow up with
OB-GYN.

#CROHN DISEASE: She was continued on humira.

#IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA: Her hematocrit was stable. She was
continued on supplemental iron.

Constipation
Dislodged tubal ligation clip

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to participate in your care. You were admitted
with abdominal pain. You had an MRI that did not show any new
fistulas. You had a CT scan that was also negative. You were
seen by the GI specialists. Constipation may have been
contributing to your symptoms so it is important to take
medication to prevent this. If you don't have a bowel movement
despite taking these medications please contact your GI doctor
Mary Dr. Harvey for further instructions. Your
symptoms improved and you were discharged home.

Importantly, as we discussed, the CT scan showed that one of the
tubal ligation clips has dislodged. It may be possible for you
to become pregnant at this time so we recommend using an
alternative form of contraception. We have arranged for a follow
up appointment with your OB-GYN doctor.

Followup Instructions:
Refrain from smoking or using tobacco products completely."

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. Lopez is an 1991 y/o man with PMH notable for ESRD on HD
and recent Chronic s/p Burr hole sent to the ED for altered mental
status. He was at his nursing home and found to have altered
mental status at 8:30 am. At that time, T 96.5, P 80 bpm, BP
120/70, RR 40, 93% on NRB and 88% on NC (later reported 83% on
RA). He was diaphoretic at the time FSBS 145. Per NH reports, he
had dialysis on 2025-03-08. He was sent to the Medanta The Medicity
emergency room for further evaluation. There, he was noted to
have a rectal temp 100.7, RR 30, P 80 bpm, and BP 112/90. His O2
sat was 98% on NRB. CXR showed left base atelectasis versus
infiltrate; CT head demonstrated SDH and he was then transferred
to Riverbend Medical for further evaluation with neurosurgery.
.
In the ED, initial vitals BP 85/48, HR 110, RR 24, 100% on NRB.
He was found to be hyperkalemic and received calcium gluconate,
D50/insulin. Due to decreased mental status, he was intubated
with 20 mg etomidate and 40 mg rocuronium. He was hypotensive to
the 90 â 120 mmHg (Normal) and started on levophed gtt. Right femoral CVL was
placed for IV access. He was noted to have dark brown output
(400 cc in total) from his NGT. He received 2 U FFP and vitamin
K as well as profilin (activated factor 9). He received
vancomycin 1 g X 1 and zosyn.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient he was intubated and sedated
with markedly distended abdomen.

CT head (2025-04-04): FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is a hypodense left
subdural collection, not significantly changed in size. There
has been interval decrease in the amount of pneumocephalus and
rightward shift of midline structures, now measuring 4 mm. There
is overall less edema and mass effect, as the sulci are better
defined on this study. There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage
or right extra- axial collection. Basal cisterns are patent.
Burr holes within the left frontal and parietal calvarium are
unchanged. IMPRESSION: Left subdural collection, unchanged in
size, with slight decrease in rightward shift of midline
structures and sulcal effacement.

CT thorax 2025-04-04 BASES: There are small bilateral pleural
effusions, with associated atelectasis. Pacer wires are
incompletely imaged on this study. Median sternotomy and
surgical clips are consistent with history of CABG. There is no
pericardial effusion. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS
CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, and adrenals are
normal. The kidneys are atrophic, with multiple vascular
calcifications, unchanged. Pancreas is atrophic. Nasogastric
tube terminates just distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
There is fluid within the dependent portion of the esophagus
(2:4). Small bowel is unremarkable. The colon diffusely is
markedly distended, measuring up to 7.7 cm in diameter, and
contains a large amount of fecal material, particularly in the
rectum. There is no pneumatosis, bowel wall thickening, or
abnormal bowel wall enhancement. There is no free fluid or free
air within the abdomen. There is no mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The aorta demonstrates marked
atherosclerotic calcifications and noncalcified
ulcerative plaques. The origins of the celiac axis and superior
mesenteric
artery are calcified but patent. The inferior mesenteric artery
which arises from the aortic aneurysm, does not opacify.
Infrarenal aortic aneurysm, measuring up to 4.5 cm in diameter,
is stable and demonstrates peripheral thrombus. The iliac
arteries are heavily calcified but patent as visualized. CT OF
THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is significant
amount of fecal material throughout the colon. The rectum is
distended with stool. There is a Foley catheter within the
urinary bladder, with air in the non-dependent portion of the
urinary bladder. There is no free pelvic fluid, and no pelvic or
inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are multilevel degenerative changes of the
lumbar spine and calcified intervertebral discs of the
thoracolumbar junction.
IMPRESSION:
1. No secondary signs of bowel ischemia.
2. The inferior mesenteric artery does not opacify, and
originates from the
infrarenal aortic aneurysm. The celiac axis and superior
mesenteric artery
are heavily calcified but patent.
3. Stable infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, measuring up to
4.5 cm in
diameter, and demonstrating peripheral thrombus.
4. Distended colon measuring up to 7.7 cm, containing abundant
amount of
fecal material.

EKG: afib ~105. IVCD. LAD. no ischemic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 1991 y/o man with ESRD on HD and SDH s/p recent evacuation
per NSG admitted with altered mental status.
.
# Shock, likely septic in etiology: Potential sources include
urine (though only 61 WBCs with culture pending) and
intra-abdominal. Should also consider CNS source with recent
instrumentation. Of these most concerning would be mesenteric
ischemia secondary to atrial fibrillation
- aggressive volume repletion to CVP 5 mmHg (normal)
- continue vasopressors as necessary
- surgery consult for acute abdomen
- broad spectrum antibiotics

Surgical consult revealed a massively distended, diffusely
tender abdomen with increase tenderness in left lower quadrant
with guarding and rebound tenderness. His lactate level was 8
and he was hemodynamically unstable. I discussion was held with
his 3 children. The very poor prognosis, even with surgical
intervention was conveyed to them, but they wished to proceed
with an exploratory laparotomy.

The patient was found to have a completely necrotic sigmoid
colon from the distal descending colon to the peritoneal
reflection despite good vascular pulses in the mesentary. The
transverse colon was massively dilated, but viable. There were
two patchy areas of complete full thickness ischemia in the
distal terminal ileum. Once again there were strong pulses
leading to these ischemia areas. A total abdominal colectomy
with resection of the ischemic ileum in continuity was performed
and an end ileostomy was made. The patient was taken intubated
and on pressors to the ICU for recovery.

He remained unstable for 2 days, and then became hemodynamically
refractile to pressors with increasing acidosis. A family
conference was held< and he was made CMO.

.
# Altered mental status: likely related to abdominal sepsis in
compromised host. no clear change in head imaging per Neurosurg
to explain.
- Neurosurgery team following
.
# Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection during
altered mental status. currently oxygenation well on current
vent settings.
- continue current vent settings with wean FIO2 by sats
- VAP prevention bundle
- PPI
.
# ESRD on HD:
- Renal team consulted from ED
.
# Elevated INR: Unclear if drawn from heparinized line or due to
primary coagulopathy (i.e., DIC). Platelets normal so DIC less
likely. Received vitamin K and FFP in the ED with plan for
reversal to < 1.4 per NSG.
- repeat coags
.
# Hepatitis: likely related to shock liver from sepsis
# FEN: NPO
.
# ACCESS: Right femoral line, AV fistula
.
# PPx: no heparin given, BID PPI, no need for bowel meds
currently
.
# CODE: CMO
.
# COMMUNICATION: with daughters and son
.
# DISPO: ICU care

On 2025-01-29 Patient made CMO after discussion with his daughters

History of Present Illness:
1977 year old woman with h/o celiac disease, pernicious anemia,
Ulcerative Colitis, addison's, polyglandular syndrome?, s/p
Partial fundiplication who p/w abdominal pain with nausea,
vomitting, diarrhea. The patient has a very extensive workup
for persistent nausea, abd pains - located midepigastric region
and RLQ area, and watery diarrhea. She has been admitted 4
times in the past six months.

By reports, she initially presented in 1999 with diarrhea,
abd pain. Colonoscopy and EGD at that time showed mild
diverticulosis, bx from antrum revealed mild chronic gastritis,
SB bx nl. She was somehow diagnosed with celiac disease (report
of dermatitis hermatiformis in the records) and placed on
gluten-free diet. Despite the gluten free diet, she still had
5x/day of diarrhea, persisent abd pain. Workup for the diarrhea
included VIP, calcitonin, SPEP, somatostatin, 24 hr HIAA,
metanephrine,normetahnephrine, and antihistaminsgastrin - all
normal. Stool cxs were negative. Only abnormality was an
elevated gastrin(241 with upper normal at 100).

In 1999, she was diagnosed with Addison's disease and was
admitted to OSH due to n/v, abd pain and inability to tolerate
PO hydrocortisoneon. Apparently cortisol stim test showed levels
of 3.04, 10.58 (30 mins), and 13.3 (60 mins).
She was admitted from 2025-01-07 and given iv hydrocortisone.
She obtained a abd CT which showed pneumobilia, but no
significant Liver shows cirrhotic changes. A MRI abdomen showed no pancreatic tumor.
Adrenal glands and kidneys unremarkable. TSH, ESR, CRP nl. EGD
- showed hemorrhagic gastritis and Colonoscopy with no Normal colonic mucosa, no lesions seen.

She still had persistent pain and was admitted on 2025-01-07 for an
xlap. The report suggested that it was remarkable for lack of
adhesions. They identified small areas of endometriosis (small
R lateral wall) which was cauterized. A few adhesions were
lysed. She was discharged on 2025-01-07 and claimed that there was
some improvement.

She was again admitted for same complaints of abd pain, N/V/D on
2025-01-07. And CT on 2025-01-07 showed no pathology and pelvic U/S
showed no torsion, s/p R oophorectomy. And discharged on 2025-01-07.

On 2025-01-07 - ""passed out"" and was seen in the ER. She went to see
her endocrinologist today who recommended that she make the trip
down to South Monica for further workup. Her husband also notes that
she was given (he thinks) 16mg of Medrol to start (112mg
Prednisone Equivelent) but isn't positive that, that is the
dose. She has not started that on top of her prednisone yet.

In the ED: VS: 98.4 72 128/86 22 98% on RA. She was given
morphine, zofran, and phenergan.

ROS: LGTemp of 99 degress. Denies chills. + Fatigue, weakness,

Small Bowel Follow-Through pending at time of discharge

Brief Hospital Course:
1977 yo woman h/o pernicious anemia (see below), celiac disease,
?ulcerative colitis, addison's disease, endometriosis with
extensive surgery history (s/p Nissen fundiplication, s/p cecal
volvulus repair, lysis adhesions, TAH, biliary sphincterotomy)
admitted with abd pain, N/V/D. Past workup significant for
elevated gastrin level, EEG stim test, reduced Vit B12.

1. Abdomen pain
- cause unclear. EGD, colonoscopy, x-lap, abd CT, MRI, LFT's
unremarkable. Although pain certainly possible with Addison's,
the persistent pain after steroid replacement is rather unusual.
Other possibilities: endometriosis, AIP, dyspepsia, IBS,
abdominal migraine, gastrinoma (elevated gastrin levels likely
due to PPI), postsurgical related pain, vasculitis (unlikely).
Nothing in the reports suggests that she has UC.
  - GI consult was obtained with Dr. Daniel Williams. He recommended a
push-enteroscopy which was signigiant only for mild gastritis. A
small bowel follow through was also performed and is pending at
time of discharge.
  - During enteroscopy the pH of the stomach was measured at 3.0
which rules out pernicous anemia.
  - stopped carafate, start low dose PPI (10mg omeprazole)
  - very low ESR, CRP
  - may also consider secretin stimulation test (although
gastrinoma unlikely) which is only performed at Dr. Bryan Stewart
Bryan Stewart practice, and she will follow up with him at the
appointment below.
  - morphine, antiemetics
  - cont with prednisone, although the timing of her symptoms
appear to actually be related to the onset of the steroids
rather than the abscense of them.

2. Diarrhea - stool cultures, secretory/infectious causes workup
largely negative
  - imodium PRN
  - DC magnesium
  - possibly related to nexium, which was reduced

3. Addison's - no evidence of polyglandular syndrome - TSH wnl
and no evidence of diabetes (occasional elevated glucose).
  - Hgb A1c was normal
  - cannot check ACTH/cortisol while on prednisone
  - checked renin level (for mineralocorticoid deficiency) which
is pending at time of discharge
  - may benefit from florinef at some point
  - Given the onset of her symptoms is always 14 hours after
taking a prednisone tablet, and I observed it 45 minutes after
administering a piggyback of hydrocortisone, particularly with
""shaking"" this may be the onset of the steroids rather than
adrenal crisis. Complicating this is that she gets very tense,
which if she had carotid body hypersensitivity, this would cause
reactive hypotension. I am recommended that she taper down the
dose, and as she has seen undigested pills in her feces, that
she take liquid prednisone which may work better in her high-pH
environment. This is a 6 week slow taper.

Discharge Instructions:
Please return to the hospital with fever/chills, inability to
eat, low blood sugar, low blood pressure.

For further diagnosis it is important to get more information
about your daily activities. You will need to keep a log of your
day. This is actually quite difficult: Please log your blood
sugar and blood pressure 4 times/day (on awakening, before
lunch, before dinner and before bedtime). Please also log
EXACTLY what you eat (for instance, ""steak with butter and
garlic"" rather than just ""steak""). Then if you experience one of
the episodes, please record your pulse, blood sugar and blood
pressure. Also please log exactly what situation you were in
when the episode occured. Please bring this log to your doctors,
including the visit with Dr. Bryan Stewart you return.

You should discuss with your endocrinologist about adding
Fludricortisone (Florinef) to your steroid regimen.

You should confirm with your endocrinologist about the medrol
dosing, as this would be a 10x increase in your steroid dosing.
We are discharging you on a steroid taper as the shaking
appeared here in the hospital with administration with steroids.

You are being discharged on the painkiller morphine. This
medication can make you drowsy and confused. Do not operate any
machinery, drive or put yourself in situations where having
impaired thinking is dangerous. It can also be constipating. If
you find yourself constipated, you can try over the counter
Mirilax; if this is unsuccessful, contact your doctor for
assistance as this can become serious.

As you are on high dose steroid, watch for unusual infections
such as white plaques in your mouth, difficulty breathing, or
fevers.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. York is a 2010 yo F in good health on fertility treatment
(Clomid, day #5) who presented to outside hospital with
abdominal pain and CT scan concerning for acute appendicitis as
well as a 6.2 x 3.7-cm cyst in the right adnexa with a small
amount of pelvic free fluid. She underwent transvaginal ultra
sound that showed multiple cysts in the right ovary with
appearances consistent with multiple follicles. Informed consent
was obtained and she was taken to the operating room and
underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. Please see operative report
for details. After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived on the floor tolerating clears and on IV fluids.
The patient was hemodynamically stable.

When tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain
medication with continued good effect. Diet was progressively
advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability.
The patient voided without problem. During this hospitalization,
the patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with
respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively
participated in the plan of care. The patient received
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this
stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. The patient was discharged home without services.
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with
the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. York,

You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service on 2025-07-02
with abdominal pain and found to have an infection in your
appendix. You were taken to the operating room and had it
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and
are now ready to be discharged to home with the following
discharge instructions:

ACTIVITY:

o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs.
o You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o Don't lift more than 120 kg lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you
can resume tub baths or swimming.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL:
o You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your
throat during surgery.
o You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping.
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem
unappealing.
o All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go
away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon.

YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks.
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe,
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may
resume tub baths or swimming.

YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"".
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to
take, please call your surgeon.

Chief Complaint:
right testicular pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right scrotal exploration, bilateral orchiopexy

History of Present Illness:
1996 with no past medical history who presents with 9 hours of
severe right testicular pain. The patient developed a dull,
nagging pain of the right testis last night, but was able to go
to sleep. He awoke this morning at 7AM with severe, 4/10 (moderate) right
testicular pain. Nothing made the pain better and it was worse
with movement. He tried to go to work, but the pain persisted.
He
did not arrive to the ED for evaluation until this afternoon at
4pm. His exam was consistent with torsion, so a manual detorsion
was attempted. An testicular ultrasound was then performed which
showed no flow in the right testis. Urology was then consulted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ashley Walsh is a 2007 old woman with longstanding diabetes
(which has been poorly controlled), hypertension, coronary
artery disease, hypercholesterolemia,
lumbar radiculopathy and a long history of smoking who presented
to the ED after one week of progressive gait problems and
frequent falls.

Ms. Walsh was admitted to the Neurology service for further
evaluation. It was thought that her gait disorder was
multifactorial in nature. She was found to be quite dehydrated,
and noted that she'd had decreased PO intake over the last week
because of decreased appetite. She did not have orthostatic
vital signs checked in the ED, but on the floor was noted to
drop from 140 lying to 90 systolic when standing. She was given
IV fluids, and following discussion with her PCP, the decision
was made to decrease her carvedilol dose (and to possibly taper
off in the future). With this she had a significant improvement
in her orthostasis, with only a 10 point drop in systolic blood
pressure when standing. While medication adjustment improved
her orthostasis significantly, she still may have an autonomic
neuropathy secondary to her poorly controlled diabetes which was
contributing to her symptoms, and outpatient follow-up with the
Apollo Medical Center clinic should be considered.

In addition to the above concerns, her gait instability likely
due to her peripheral neuropathy secondary to her diabetes, with
decreased vibration and pinprick to the level of the knee.

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy prior to
discharge, with significant improvement in her gait, and was
cleared to be discharged home.

Chief Complaint:
""I am having PTSD""

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Wilson is a 1976 year old male with a history of bipolar
disorder, self-reported history of PTSD, multiple psychiatric
hospitalizations who brought himself into the Singapore General Hospital ED for
symptoms of PTSD and inability to care for himself after being
""thrown out of the Stephanieberg for loitering.""

Pt reports that he had worked as an Lobbyist on 2025-03-08
at Lisafort and was ""triggered"" by the negative emotions
expressed by his co-workers in the aftermath of the election.
Additionally, he says that he has been experiencing several
'coincidences' recently including meeting a small child who was
selling paintings in East Christianmouth and who he thought was abandoned. This
sparked memories of his own childhood issues with feeling
abandoned and neglected by his mother and the ""bad things"" his
stepfather did. He had initially presented to the Singapore General Hospital ED, had
done intake, and decided to go to the hospital chapel. At that
point he was accosted by 10 hospital security guards who twisted
his arm, took photos of his hospital ID and face, and threw him
out on to the street after yelling ""go back to your country."" He
ran over to the Singapore General Hospital ED and feels less depressed here since
everyone has been nice. He feels ""connected"" to the BI since he
knows the daughter of a surgeon here and his cousin was born
here.

In early Feb 2023, he has feeling quite depressed for which his
psychiatrist Dr. Denise Baker (Brian Winters can be reached at +916953057749 or via email at lisa28@example.net. Correspondence may be sent to 8616 Daniels Rue
East Deanna, MD 50571, Villanuevaport, Rhode Island - 44601, India.) put him on a trial of a
stimulant. This medication helped with the depression but put
him
into a manic phase for 4 weeks during which he felt ""high."" He
was treated at Singapore General Hospital for PTSD and mania and placed him
on Lithium which he says did not help much. He was there for 4
days after which he was supposed to go to a partial hospital
program but did not end up going. He says that he has been
inconsistent with taking his Lithium (per his memory, he was on
1000-1200 mg of Lithium and his last Total Cholesterol: 211 mg/dL level was 0.8). He says
that he does not need any sleep or anxiety medications since he
has been sleeping well and feels rested upon waking up. He does
note decreased interest in activities recently.

Per patient, denies SI, HI, AVH, nightmares, paranoia.

PTSD with relatively euthymic affect, paranoid thought content
regarding legal authorities. Admitted to Deaconess 4 due to
concerns for worsening psychosis, inability to care for self or
protect self in the community with recent indecent exposure at
the Stephanieberg per OMR.

#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted on a Voluntary, upon
admission, signed a CV, which was accepted. Patient reported he
did not want to be on the unit any longer and so signed a 3 day
notice dated 2025-03-08. Given his good behavioral control,
appropriate ADL's and interactions, medication compliance, and
consistent denial of SI/HI, I did not believe he met
criteria to file a 7&8b. Of note, he maintained good behavioral
control throughout his admission on 15 minute checks and did not
require physical or chemical restraints.

#. Bipolar disorder: Type I, with psychotic features
- Patient was compliant in attending groups, where he
participated appropriately.
- With the patient's permission, we spoke with his outpatient
psychiatrist, Dr. Denise Baker agreed with inpatient level of
care and initiation of an antipsychotic medication at this time.

- After discussion of the risks and benefits, we started Latuda
20 mg po qd, which was titrated to 40 mg po qd. Patient
tolerated this well with no complaints of side effects and with
improvement in psychotic symptoms with lessening of his
persecutory delusions, more organized thought process and with
improved insight and judgment. Recommendation is to continue
titration of Latuda as clinically indicated and as tolerated.
- Given good response the past, we continued his lithium at 900
mg po qhs and 600 mg po qam with no complaints of side effects.
Lithium level on 2025-03-08 was slightly elevated on 2025-03-08 1.2 but
recheck of Lithium level was 0.6 on 2025-03-08.
- Patient was compliant with medications and participatory in
his care, consistently denying suicidal ideation or thoughts of
self harm during his admission. By time of discharge, he stated
he would like to attend a partial program, which was reasonable,
and a referral was made (see discharge worksheet). He refused to
allow us to obtain collateral from his family members.

Arthrotomy of right glenohumeral joint with washout (2025-04-23)
PICC placement in left arm (2025-04-23)

History of Present Illness:
1994 M with CKDIV, DM2, hypertension, gout, and chronic right
shoulder pain who was recently admitted in 2025-06-10 after
experiencing a fall with severe rotator cuff tear who is now
transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital ED from OSH for significant right shoulder
erythema and swelling. He was previously seen by the ortho
trauma service on 2025-02-12 with right shoulder swelling viewed on
x-ray and MRI showing large right shoulder collection without
intraarticular involvement, as well as a large rotator cuff
tear. He underwent a diagnostic tap at that time which showed
39k WBCs but negative cultures and he improved without
antibiotics. He was just seen in f/u by Dr. Attend weekly follow-up visits for close monitoring. on 2025-08-05
for his right rotator cuff tear - due to lack of any pain the
decision was made for conservative management. He says that over
the past 1 week his right should swelling and redness has
significantly worsened, much worse than previously. He has some
subjective chills occasionally but no fevers and no other
infectious symptoms.

He underwent an I&D in the ED showing > 100,000 K WBCs but
negative gram stain. He was subsequently started on IV
vancomycin.

This AM he underwent surgical arthrotomy of the shoulder
draining a large amount of pus from the left shoulder from an
abscess which involves the glenohumeral joint.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Stephanie Perez is a 2016 s/p repeat LTCS 2025-05-27 at 28w5d for
worsening HELLP. She had initially presented for elevation of
new onset elevated blood pressures and was initially
asymptomatic. Her prior obstetric history was notable for
severe pre-eclampsia and pulmonary edema requiring delivery at
34 weeks. She had severe range blood pressures and ruled in for
severe pre-eclampsia, was started on Magnesium. She developed
acute episode of epigastric pain radiating to her mid-scapular
area. She had a RUQ ultrasound that demonstrated pleural
effusions bilaterally and edematous gallbladder, thought to be a
sign of acute hepatitis/third-spacing. Also noted to have acute
worsening of LFTs, from 50-60s on 2025-08-08 AM to 300s 2025-08-11 02:59 PM, and
platelets from 139 to 64, all consistent with HELLP. She
underwent repeat LTCS on 2025-05-27, which was overall
uncomplicated, EBL 750cc. Magnesium was discontinued after 2
hours given finding of pleural effusion and history of pulmonary
edema.

On post-op day#3 (2025-03-13), she developed worsening RUQ pain, worse
than at time of admission. On exam, was noted to have RUQ
tenderness and palpable firmness. RUQ U/S demonstrated new large
subcapsular hematoma, 18cm in maximum dimension. ACS consulted
and recommended bedrest, serial exams, serial CBC, and CT scan.
Hct trended and stable between 34-44%. VSS. Given potential for
hepatic rupture and hemodynamic instability warranting possible
need for urgent laparotomy/ACS eval, decision was made to
transfer patient to Max Super Speciality Hospital intensive care unit for
close monitoring.

Her pain had been moderately well controlled with PO dilaudid
(holding NSAIDs given GI bleeding risk and Tylenol given
transaminitis/hematoma).

She did spike a low grade fever 2025-02-08 02:18 AM, but defervesced quickly
and had no other localizing signs or symptoms of infection, so
an inflammatory response was suspected. Urine culture was
normal. Blood cultures were sent and were negative. Her
leukocytosis was stable at around 18.

For her HELLP/pre-eclampsia, LFTs initially remained elevated
but the downtrended. For her blood pressures, she required
initiation and uptitration of PO Nifedipine to BID dosing.

For Stage 3, Cre stabilized at 2.6-2.7 and then improved. Renal
following and suspected underlying acute tubular necrosis. Her
urine output remained excellent.

On 2025-03-13 (POD#4) she was transferred to the SICU on the Apollo Medical Center
Harrisborough for observation. She was transferred back on 2025-03-13.

On 2025-03-13 (POD#5), she was transferred out to the post partum
floor, where her course was as follows:

*) severe preeclampsia/HELLP/Subcapsular hematoma
- s/p Magnesium x2h (d/c'ed early)
- nifedipine for HTN
- per ACS, no activity restrictions and monitor for signs of
hepatic rupture

*) 6 weeks postpartum
- voiding spontaneously, monitor Is&Os

*) Postpartum
- regular diet
- anemia Septic Shock due to Pneumonia surgery, hemolysis, hematoma: s/p 1 unit pRBC 2025-05-24,

QRS 100 ms

IMAGING:
CXR (AP) 2025-08-08
FINDINGS:
Compared with the prior study, lung volumes are lower, causing
bronchovascular
crowding. The heart size is exaggerated from the AP projection. No new focal
consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Incidental note is made of
embolization coils and a TIPS stent.
IMPRESSION:
No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.

DUPLEX ULTRASOUND ABD 2025-04-20
IMPRESSION:
1. Continued patency of the TIPS, with slight interval decrease
in intra TIPS
velocities.
2. Coarsened nodular liver is consistent with known cirrhosis.
3. 2 cm heterogeneous area in the right lobe of is compatible
with known RFA
site.
4. A segment VIII lesion identified on prior studies is better
evaluated on
the recent multi phasic abdominal CT.
5. Cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Delgado is a 1994 with a history of EtOH/HBV/HDV cirrhosis
s/p TIPS (2025-01-01), baseline MELD 20, on transplant list with
myalgias and found to have hyperkalemia in the setting of
worsened renal function. He was given fluids and diuretics were
held with improvement.

# Hyperkalemia - K of 5.4 at admission. Normalized after 2L NS
in the ED and holding diuretics. Likely due to pre-renal
azotemia. He perhaps has decreasing diuretic need following his
TIPS.

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Likely pre-renal due to
overdiuresis given resolved with 2L NS. He does not have other
signs of decompensated cirrhosis, so hepatorenal syndrome is
less likely. His Cr remained stable at 1.4 at discharge.

# Myalgias and cramps - Appears chronic. Improved without
intervention. Flu swab was negative. EKG was nonischemic. He
was started on magnesium oxide supplementation at discharge.

# HBV/EtOH Cirrhosis: Appeared to be compensated. His MELD was
stable at 28. He was continued on home regimen except for
diuretics.

Chief Complaint:
Neck pain, R arm weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Revision posterior cervical decompression C6-T1, Instrumented
posterior fusion C3-T1 with ICBG

History of Present Illness:
I had the pleasure of seeing this patient who complains of acute
onset of right hand weakness and difficulty using his hands with
pain that goes down the back of his arm into his ulnar forearm.
He is a previous Lecturer, higher education and finds difficulty holding
things. It is getting worse. In 2018, he had anterior cervical
decompression and fusion from C4-C6 followed by a posterior
cervical fusion with instrumentation without decompression from
C3-C7. He comes in for further evaluation of his right upper
extremity weakness. He has pain that he rates as 1/10 (mild) and 1/10 (mild)
with activity and flexing forward makes it worse. He has no
bowel or bladder incontinence. No left upper extremity
symptoms.

He has asthma and allergies, but otherwise healthy.

He has had bilateral carpal tunnel release and shoulder surgery.

His medications include Advair, ProAir, Singulair, simvastatin,
gabapentin for approximately one week.

He has allergies to IVP dye with hives and swelling.

He is currently disabled. He is a previous smoker. He does not
smoke currently. He is married.

Family history is significant for blood disorders and platelet
disorder, otherwise healthy.

He is cm: 193 | m: 1.47 | ft: 6â²6â³ feet 9 inches and 200 pounds.

Multiple studies were reviewed. These include the following:
1. EMG nerve conduction study performed on 2025-01-17,
consistent with a right C8 radiculopathy.
2. An MRI done on 2025-03-28, which shows previous surgery
with foraminal stenosis at C7-T1 with compression of the C8
nerve
root.
3. The CT report is not available for review, but I reviewed the
CT from 2025-04-07, which shows a pedicle screw at the C7 with
halo bilaterally with traverse of the right foramen of C7-T1.
There is no clear fusion posteriorly. There is a clear fusion
in
the upper cervical spine and there is some lucency around the C6
nerve roots. There is no breakage on the hardware. His overall
alignment on last x-rays was within normal limits. New x-rays
and CT are pending.

On physical examination, this is a healthy-appearing male.
Affect is within normal limits. Gait is within normal limits.
He has 4/5 - Active movement against gravity and some resistance strength in bilateral upper extremities except in his
interosseous, finger extension, flexion and abduction. His
triceps is 4/5 - Active movement against gravity and some resistance on the right side. He has a negative shoulder
exam. He has a negative Lhermitte's. He has pain with forward
flexion. His sensation is grossly intact to light touch.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the Medanta The Medicity Spine Surgery Service and
taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure. Refer to
the dictated operative note for further details. The surgery
was without complication and the patient was transferred to the
PACU in a stable condition.

TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 24hrs postop per
standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled with a
PCA. Diet was advanced as tolerated. The patient was
transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating PO diet.

Patient ambulated independently without the need for physical
therapy. His R upper extremity symptoms were improved post
operatively. Drain was removed on POD 2. Wound was clean and
dry.

Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. On the day of
discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs,
comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.

Discharge Instructions:
You have undergone the following operation: Posterior Cervical
Decompression and Fusion

Immediately after the operation:

â¢ Activity: You should not lift anything greater
than 10 lbs for 2 weeks. You will be more comfortable if you do
not sit in a car or chair for more than ~45 minutes without
getting up and walking around.

â¢ Rehabilitation/ Physical Therapy:

Occasionally times a day you should go for a walk
for 1.5:1 minutes as part of your recovery. You can walk as
much as you can tolerate.

8 Isometric Extension Exercise in the
collar: 2x/day x 8xercises as
instructed.

â¢ Cervical Collar / Neck Brace: You need to wear
the brace at all times until your follow-up appointment which
should be in 2 weeks. You may remove the collar to take a
shower. Limit your motion of your neck while the collar is off.
Place the collar back on your neck immediately after the shower.

â¢ Wound Care: Remove the dressing in 2 days. If
the incision is draining cover it with a new sterile dressing.
If it is dry then you can leave the incision open to the air.
Once the incision is completely dry (usually 34 days after the
operation) you may take a shower. Do not soak the incision in a
bath or pool. If the incision starts draining at anytime after
surgery, do not get the incision wet. Call the office at that
time. If you have an incision on your hip please follow the same
instructions in terms of wound care.

â¢ You should resume taking your normal home
medications.

â¢ You have also been given Additional Medications

prescriptions (oxycontin, oxycodone, percocet) to the pharmacy.
In addition, we are only allowed to write for pain medications
for 90 days from the date of surgery.

â¢ Follow up:

Avoid alcohol completely to prevent liver strain and medication interference. Please Call the office and make an
appointment for 2 weeks after the day of your operation if this
has not been done already.

A monthly check-up is recommended to assess ongoing stability. At the 2-week visit we will check your
incision, take baseline x rays and answer any questions.

A monthly check-up is recommended to assess ongoing stability. We will then see you at 6 weeks from the
day of the operation. At that time we will most likely obtain
Flexion/Extension X-rays and often able to place you in a soft
collar which you will wean out of over 1 week.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 foramenotomies


History of Present Illness:
I had the pleasure of seeing Michelle Rogers here. I have not seen her
in a couple of years. She did reasonably well with the right
side with several levels of foraminotomies. She now has
left-sided symptoms that are very similar and foraminal
narrowing
at three levels on the left side. She has had a tough time with
this and not had much benefit from physical therapy or
injections
and the pain has worsened since I last saw her. She would like
to pursue surgery on the left side now. I went over the risks
and benefits and details. It would be very similar to the other
side with L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1 foraminotomies and we will plan
to schedule this in the near future if she calls back. She is
going to think about it and try and see when her schedule might
work out. I spent approximately 35 minutes with her and believe
I answered her questions and concerns to the best of my ability.

Brief Hospital Course:
2019 year old female with lumbar stenosis was admitted for
elective, uncomplicated Bilateral L3-L4, L4-L5, and S1
foraminotomies. The patient's diet was advanced post-operatively
and her pain was controlled with oral narcotics and
acetaminophen and anti-spasmotics. Her neurological exam was
intact for the first two full days post-operatively. On
discharge she demonstrated decreased iliopsoas strength that was
related to poor pain control in the setting of spasm. The
remainder of her sensory and strength exam was intact distally.
Upon discharge she denied other medical complaints, she was
tolerating a diet, voiding normally, stooling normally, and
ambulating with physical therapy. Physical therapy recommended
discharge to home based on deconditioning in the setting of
longstanding lumbar radiculopathy.

2011 y/o hispanic female visiting from 19 who presents with
complaints of abdominal pain of of four days duration. Patient
lives in the country side of 15, having contact with
chickens and cows. She drinks water from a well. She complains
of having frequent watery stools over the last year, not noting
blood in her stool, but has noted mucous. Her son, who
currently lives in 19, has been treated for
similar symptoms in the past for ""amebomas."" Patient endorses a
30 pound weight loss of the last year, but says it was
intentional to combat her diabetes. She does not describe,
however, any restricted diet or exercise to explain the weight.
   Four days prior to presentation, the patient developed severe
2/10 (mild) epigastric pain. She has noted black stools since that
time and has experienced some light headedness. She denies any
fever/chills. She has not had any shortness of breath, chest
pain, or palpitatons. To treat her abdominal pain she was
taking NSAIDS.

EGD:

Findings: Esophagus:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the whole esophagus.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Erythema and congestion of the mucosa were noted in the
fundus, stomach body and antrum. These findings are compatible
with mild gastritis. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology at the stomach antrum.
 Excavated Lesions A few erosions were noted in the antrum.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the second part of the
duodenum. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at
the second part of the duodenum.
 Excavated Lesions A single superficial non-bleeding 1cm ulcer
was found in the duodenal bulb.
Impression: Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus
Erosions in the antrum
Erythema and congestion in the fundus, stomach body and antrum
compatible with mild gastritis (biopsy)
Ulcer in the duodenal bulb
Normal mucosa in the second part of the duodenum (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
#) Melena: Description of stools concerning for UGIB. Given use
of NSAIDS and epigastric pain, cocern for PUD vs. GU vs.
gastritis. Patient's hct fell from 38 to 31 after 2L IVF with
guiac + stool. Follow up hcts remained stable. Patient
underwent an EGD which revelaled a non-bleeding ulcer of the
duodenom and gastritis. Patient was started on PPI BID for 6
weeks. Biopsy results were taken and should be followed up.
Patient is scheduled for an outpatinet screening colonoscopy.
.
#) Abd Pain: Most likely secondary to observed duodenal ulcer.
Patient remained free during admissio no evidence of fevers, no
abnormality besides fatty liver on ultrasound. Patient had
prior No. LFTs unremakrable.
.
#) Diahrea: Given chronicity of symptoms, social history, and
son with similar symptoms, concern for parasitic source vs IBS
vs metformin induced (although she claims not temporally
linked.) No elevation of WBC and no eosinophilia. Stool
cultures collected prior to discharge for culture, DFA for
giardia/cryptosporidia, and O+P. Patient schedueld for follow
up with colonoscopy and evaluation by GI.
.
#) DM: Patient with history of diabetes, taking
metformin/glipizde at home. No glucometer and little insight
into condition. 90 mg/dL running btw 200-300 off agents while NPO.
Patient was restarted on home agents following EGD. Have
arranged follow up with a new PCP for proper education and
outpatient manegment.

Chief Complaint:
Sent in with elevated d-dimer and tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Baker is a 1973 female with a history of
opioid use disorder in remission, depression,
hypertriglyceridemia, and tobacco use disorder who was referred
to the ED by her PCP after she was found to be tachycardic in
the
150s with an elevated D-dimer.

She reports that about 10 days ago, she developed generalized
body aches, joint pain in her ankles and hands, swelling in her
ankles, mild sore throat, and canker sores in her mouth. She
went
to the Jessica Gomez ER and was discharged home with a prescription for
methocarbamol, which she started taking but this did not
alleviate her symptoms. After this, she developed a pruritic,
pustular rash over her face, chest, arms, and upper back. She
went in to urgent care on 2025-02-21 or 2025-07-10 because the
swelling
in her lower extremities was getting worse. She was prescribed
Lasix and made an appointment for follow up with her PCP on
2025-01-22. She went in to her PCP and was found to be
tachycardic with an elevated D-dimer and was sent to the ED.

Over the last 10 days, she reports her joint pain and body aches
have improved. The sore throat is resolved. The rash is stable
to
slightly improved. The Williamsburgh edema is worse, however.

She denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
lightheadedness/dizziness. No coughing or hemoptysis. No
orthopnea or PND. No headaches, visual changes. No abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. She is slightly constipated.
No
dysuria, no frothy urine.

She has not been immobilized. No long distance travel recently.
She does smoke cigarettes and does not take OCPs. Jonathanside edema is
symmetric. No personal history of malignancy. No family history
of clotting disorder. No history of miscarriage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Baker is a 1973 female with a history of opioid use
disorder in remission, depression, hypertriglyceridemia, and
tobacco use disorder who was referred to the ED by her PCP for
tachycardia and an elevated D-dimer. She was found to have a
small segmental PE. Also with an odd constellation of new
symptoms including recent facial and truncal macular/acneiform
rash, new bilateral Jonathanside edema and hand puffiness, aphthous
ulcers, polyarthralgias, and pharyngitis.

# RLL segmental PE
This preliminarily appears to be an unprovoked PE. She does not
take OCPs and is not currently pregnant. When her labs were last
checked, her folate level was undetectable. It is unclear why
her folate level would be so low as she does not have an alcohol
use disorder and has no dietary restrictions. Perhaps elevated
homocysteine levels in the setting of folate deficiency could
have predisposed her to thrombosis? Beta-2-Glycoprotein
antibodies and cardiolipin antibodies were sent and are pending.

She was started on warfarin 5 mg daily with a lovenox bridge
(her health insurance generally does not approve DOACs without a
warfarin failure). She was treated with Lovenox, which will be
continued to therapeutic INR. She will be followed at Apollo Medical Center
Keithmouth clinic, and arrangements were made for her to
get her INRs checked at Port April, which is closer to her
home.
Unless her odd constellation of symptoms is found to be a
reversible process that could potentially explain her VTE, she
will likely need lifelong anticoagulation.

# Bilateral Jonathanside edema
Non-pitting lower extremity edema and puffy hands in a pattern
clinically more suggestive of myxedema than anything else,
although TSH was not abnormal. LENIs were negative for DVT
bilaterally. JVP and BNP were low and TTE was unremarkable, so
CHF is excluded. LFTs are within normal limits and she has no
history of chronic liver disease. No proteinuria, so nephrotic
syndrome is excluded. She had been trying Lasix and NSAIDs for
the swelling previously, but was counseled that these are both
unlikely to help and was given compression stockings.

# Polyarthralgias
# Pustular rash
# Aphthous ulcers
The patient was seen by rheumatology, who suspected a viral
syndrome; they comment that SLE could explain some of the
symptoms, and also comment that while Behcet's may present with
oral ulcer associated with VTE, it is vanishingly rare in
patient's of Asian heritage. Seen by ID who did not feel that
the rash was typical of any viral exanthem, but wondered if it
could be an unusual presentation of a drug rash.
If these symptoms do not continue to improve or are recurrent,
would consider working
up for a rheumatologic process.
CRP: 120 mg/L (high), ESR: 95 mm/hr (elevated), Procalcitonin: 3.5 ng/mL (infection/sepsis) negative, CRP not elevated, HIV negative, Lyme negative, HCV

Discharge Diagnosis:
Pulmonary embolism

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a pulmonary embolism, or blood clot that
went to the lung. We are giving you warfarin (Coumadin) to thin
your blood for at least the next three months. You will take
twice daily enoxaparin (Lovenox) shots for a few days until the
warfarin has fully taken effect. We follow a measure of blood
clotting called INR to know if warfarin is being dosed
appropriately. A therapeutic INR is between 2.0 and 3.0.

You will be followed by the Apollo Medical Center clinic at Keithmouth,
which is affiliated with your PCP Michael Clark. However, you
can get your INR checked at Port April. Just go to
âpre-admissions testingâ which near the main entrance,
downstairs near Hematocrit: 38.7 %. When the lab result comes back,
you will be called by the pharmacist in town to adjust your
warfarin dose as needed.

Your first INR check will be on 2025-06-22. They tell me there will
be a standing order for labs in place and Kristina Chandler will be
expecting you, but I have also given you a paper script for
bloodwork just in case.

You also had a variety of unusual symptoms that may have been
symptoms a virus, an adverse reaction to a medication,
deficiency of the vitamin folic acid, or an autoimmune disease.
We went a very large number of tests to figure out what might be
going on. I will call you if anything really notable comes back
positive. If the symptoms persist, you have an appointment with
Dr. Reginald Patterson rheumatology to do further workup. If the
symptoms all go away, then it was unlikely to have been an
autoimmune disease and you are welcome to cancel this
appointment (+919291647967).

Brief Hospital Course:
1988 year old male with a past medical history significant for
IDDM2, CKD, anemia, HLD, HTN, obesity and is now s/p bilateral
BKA for recurrent MRSA osteomyelitis and pseudomonal ulcers who
presented with malaise and LLE cellulitis here found to be
septic upon admission likely Gabrielmouth cellulitis.

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# Sepsis Clinic visit LLE cellulitis
Patient states that came to the hospital due to feeling
generally unwell; however he denied any localizing symptoms such
as fever, cough, chest pain, dysuria. He did note a LLE blister
which he states he poppped a few days ago.
He met 271 SIRS criteria upon admission with WBC 23, temp 101.7,
HR 110s with source likely left leg cellulitis. Previous
cellulitis and osteomyelitis cultures have grown MRSA,
pan-sensitive pseudomonas, klebsiella, grp B strep. On exam,
cellulitis appears to be superficial- no evidence of crepitus or
deeper infection. He was initially treated with Vanc/Zosyn
overnight on the night of admission and then broadened to
Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl (based on prior culture data). Cultures
remained negative, WBC improved and the patient remained
afebrile, so he was transitioned to oral antibiotics on 2025-02-12
(Augmentin/Doxycycline). He will complete 7 more days of PO
antibiotics once discharged.

# Stage 2 on CKD:
Cr. 2.8 on admission but then 3.4 the next day, baseline
2.2-2.5. Likely secondary to sepsis. He received 1L NS upon
admission. Cr was trended and on day of discharge creatinine
was 2.4. Home dose losartan was initially held but was
retsarted on day of discharge.

# Transaminitis:
Patient has not had any LFTs checked since 2025-05-05, so unclear if
this is new onset or his baseline. DDx includes NASH (if
chronic) vs. Acute illness muscular breakdown (if newonset)Likely secondary to muscular breakdown Surgery cellulitis.
Currently, very low concern for intra-abdominal pathology as
abdominal exam is benign. Downtrended during hospitalization,
so most likely due to acute exacerbation muscular breakdown/due to acute exacerbation cellulitis. Should be
followed up outpatient for complete resolution.

# LUQ pain:
Patient initially complained of LUQ pain x1 day upon admission
which was thought to be musculoskeletal in nature as he
described it as spasms and worsened with movement. Improved by
the day of discharge.

# Contact dermatitis:
Erythematous rash noted throughout back. Per wife, began using
new detergent one week ago and rash coincides with using the new
detergent. He was treated with hydrocortisone topical cream 1%
BID.

# DM2:
Previosuly poorly controlled but last A1C 8.3 on 2025-04-27 which
is significantly improved from 14.8. He was continued on his
home dose lantus and sliding scale insulin.

# HTN:
Initially held home dose metoprolol and losartan in the setting
from septic shock and sepsis. Metoprolol was restarted on 2025-01-28 and well
tolerated. Losartan was restarted upon discharge once Cr was
back at baseline.
- holding home dose metoprolol and losartan in setting from septic shock
and sepsis

# Hyperkalemia:
Potassium noted to be elevated to 5.5 upon admission and was
thought to be Surgery his Normal renal function on CKD. EKG without any changes. He
received 1 dose of kayexalate and potassium then improved to wnl
and remained normal throughout the rest of his hospitalization.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# Anemia: HCT generally upper 35-45%, currently 32%
# HLD: Continued simvastatin
# BPH: Continued Tamsulosin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
- patient was initially treated with IV Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl for
LLE cellulits, blood cultures remained negative and patient was
transitioned to oral antibiotics (augmentin/doxycycline) on
2025-02-12
- patient to complete 7 more days of Augmentin/Doxycycline upon
discharge
- Cr uptrended initially, thought to be due to acute exacerbation sepsis, downtrended
prior to admission and home dose Losartan was restarted upon
discharge
- please f/u pending blood cultures (no growth at time of
discharge)
- please f/u for resolution of LLE cellulitis
- please f/u for resolution of mild transaminitis (thought to be
due to acute exacerbation muscular breakdown Surgery cellulitis) and was improving on day
of discharge

IMAGING

2025-05-28 CXR: Continued low lung volumes with substantial volume
loss in the left lower lobe. Cardiac silhouette remains
enlarged though there is little if any vascular congestion.
Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.

2025-05-28 Abd/Pelvic CT: Manifestations of pancreatic and
peripancreatic necrosis with acute neccrotic collections. 8.7 cm
fluid collection in the left paracolic gutter. 14.8 cm fluid
collection in the anterior pelvis. Moderate abdominal free fluid
tracking from the upper abdomen to the pelvis with no discrete
loculation. New splenic vein thrombosis with interval
splenomegaly measures 14.5 cm. Nonocclusive thrombus in the
proximal portal vein. Anasarca. Bilateral atelectasis.
Left-sided pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course:

Mr. Robertson was admitted 2025-01-01 as a transfer from OSH with
septic shock secondary to acute pancreatitis and ischemic bowel.
He received rapid and liberal resuscitation and appropriate
empiric broad spectrum antibiotics, then underwent exploratory
laparotomy, right colectomy and temporary abdominal wall closure
soon after arrival. During the initial postoperative period, he
continued to receive liberal IVF resuscitation and his fluid
status was monitored closely. He returned to the operating room
POD1 for a second look, and no further bowel was resected. An
end ileostomy was created, and lysis of adhesions done to free
up the bowel for this. His abdomen was left open. He was
started on enteric feeds via a post-pyloric dobhoff tube early
as well as anticipatory Precedex drip for ETOH withdrawal. His
sedation was managed by the SICU, and it was a challenge. He
required high doses of benzodiazepines for sedation and fentanyl
for pain control. By 2025-01-28, his abdominal wall remained
open, and he underwent another exploratory surgery. Mr. Robertson
was started on lasix for diuresis 2025-01-28 and the Device
patch was advanced at the bedside in stages, which the patient
tolerated well without any worrisome post-procedure increase in
peak airway or bladder pressures. 2025-01-28 he became febrile and
repeat CT abdomen revealed evidence of severe pancreatitis and
multiple rim-enhancing fluid collections. His intraabodminal
drain amylase level was >7000. Our hepatobiliary surgery team
was consulted regarding his severe pancreatitis, and likely
necrotizing pancreatitis, and they recommended holding off on
necrosectomy at that time, as the pancreas did not have foci of
air within it and did not appear to be infected. A Device
Patch was placed to enable staged abdominal wall closure and a
drain was left in the Middle Cerebral Artery space. On 2025-01-28, Mr.
Robertson returned to the operating rooom and a large intraabodminal
abscess was drained. The Device patch was removed and a
biologic mesh placed instead. Several intraabdominal and
subcutaneous drains were placed to prevent further abscess
development and a wound vac was placed over the mesh to assist
with wound healing. The intent was to encourage
epithelialization of the wound.

By system, here is the remainder of Mr. Robertson ICU course:
His postoperative course was complicated by persistent hypoxic
respiratory failure in setting of pulmonary edema now s/p
bedside tracheostomy 2025-01-28 and high ventilator requirement,
septic shock, now on CRRT with improving urine output.

Neurologic: Per family, patient at baseline has very limited
coping skills and almost no insight into his disease process.
Will likely need psychiatric evaluation once stable. Analgesia
with tylenol, dilaudid 1977 q3h prn. He required precidex and
weaned off more than once. Clonidine 0.3 patch weekly, can
consider po via post pyloric dobhoff. Ativan given prn anxiety.

Cardiovascular: Septic Shock, resolved. Tachycardic possibly
from pain or agitation. Minimal improvement with fluids. Now
with reflex tachycardia Device patch removal and weaning of
precidex. Pressors required for septic shock which were weaned
off throughout his hospital course.

Pulmonary: s/p bedside percutaneous tracheostomy (Perc-fit 8.0,
1 cm above carina). Placed back on the vent on 2025-01-28 with a RR in
the 24 breaths/min. Moderate ARDS improving. CXR stable. Tolerating trach
Mask. Passe Muir valve assessment: failed, Technical limitation to trach size.
Albuterol given prn.

GI/Abdomen: s/p right colectomy, ileostomy, Dobhoff
post-pyloric, biologic mesh overlay sewn to skin edge, multiple
drains (likely intra-abdominal source of sepsis). S/p CTAP
significant for splenic infarct. Malecot placed over fistula 2025-01-28. Ostomy appliance placed over on 2025-01-28 with ostomy nursing.
Famotidine 20 IV BID given. 2025-01-28 drains placed x2 in fluid
collection L abd and pelvis. Strict NPO with TPN for nutrition.

Renal: Anion gap metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis) resolved,
anuric when in septic shock requiring CRRT, urine o/p improving.
Baseline renal function: 0.7. Initially fluid resuscitated and
when developed sepsis IVF resuscitated. Overall fluid positive
after but had significant fluid drawn off with CRRT. By time of
transfer, HLIV.

Infectious Disease: s/p colectomy; some spillage. Continuing to
spike fevers, fungal growth in peritoneal fluid. s/p pelvic
fluid collection drainage 2025-01-28, gram stain shows MRSA positive, on
Micafungin 100 mg IV Q24H and cefepime 2gr IV Q8H, flagyl 500 mg
IV Q8H on 2025-01-28 when spiked. Infectious disease team followed him

Then Patient was transferred to the floor on 2025-01-28 until
2025-01-28.
By system, here is the remainder of Mr. Robertson regular floor
course:

General: He has been active, conscious, cooperative and
oriented.

Neuro: He has been up and walking without any assistance, pain
was initially managed by dPCA and IV break through dilaudid,
then, switched to oral oxycodone which controlled to the pain
very well.

Cardio/respiratory: he has been hemodynamically stable with
Vital signs being monitored periodically and were within normal
range. He had one episode of chest pain that's been worked out
by sending Cardiac enzymes, EKG and chest x-ray and were
negative for MI. on 2025-01-28, Tracheostomy tube has been taken out
and patient has had any problem with breathing or speaking.

GI/GU: Patient was receiving feeding through TPN and Dobhoff.
J-tube got pulled out on 2025-01-28, then diet has been advanced to
clears and VAC out put (where the fistulas are) was monitored
daily for any changes. The output were high, then patient placed
back on strict NPO. multiple trial of advancing diet attempted
but unfortunately failed. He has been voiding well without
assistance with adequate urine output. He has been having 2
enterocutaneous fistula that being covered by VAC in which has
been changing every 3 days. on 2025-01-28, 2 stitches of vicryl 2.0
has been placed on the lower fistula. Ostomy output was
monitored during hospitalization and has been productive.

Infectious: he has been on antibiotic all the period of staying
until 2025-01-28, complete blood count and chem 10 have been routinely
monitored. WBC elevated from 16 to 28 on 2025-01-28, with elevation
of temperature. work up for fever has been done as well as CT
abdomen and pelvis, PICC has been replaced and the tip has been
sent for culture. Antibiotic at this point has been started
again. all the cultures came back to be negative for any growth.
In the setting of decreasing of WBCs and patient being afebrile
decision has been made to discontinue the Antibiotics which was
on 2025-01-28.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and Device
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
and hemodynamically stable. The patient was NPO on TPN,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. Wound VAC on mid abdominal wound, 2 drains and T
tube were in place. The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.

Chief Complaint:
Long Term Monitoring and medication management for seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Taylor is a 2023 yo left-handed man with a history of a
traumatic brain injury in 1989 when riding a motorcycle. He
reportedly was not wearing a helmet while riding and became
unconscious, lost control and was comatose after 3 days. He was
not left with any motor deficits, only minor visual problems and
was able to continue working regularly.

In 1997 he began having seizures. This occurred at a time of
significant sleep depiravtion and anxeity while driving. He felt
he was going to lose consciousness and he pulled over. At that
time, he was admitted to the hospital and had an MRI and EEG. He
then remained seizure free until 1989 when he had a seizure at
2:00am, hit his head when he fell off the bed and had a
generalized seizure for 10min reportedly. After this, he was
started on LTG. Next seizure was in 1989 while in his
office and had a generaliezd seizure for 14 min with confusion
lasting 45 min after. In 1989 he had a generalized event
proceeded by several nights of poor sleep. This occurred at work
where he was found stiff, eyes rolled up and making grunting Crackles. This lasted about 2 min. Prior to this he had started on
adderall 5mg BID and this was lowered to 5mg daily. He was
started on OXC at that time.

He has also had other episodes concerning for seizure that been
described that are not generalized convulsions. These episodes
typically consist of him seemingly being less responsive in
conversation and then asking questions like where he is, what is
going on, and amnesia afterwards. After the event he is ok and
does not feel fatigued and is oriented fully. In 1989 he
had
an episode at work of yelling and not acting himself. In 1989 he had an episode of disorientation while on a bus. Around
the time of these events, he had an episode of nresponsiveness
and biting the inside of his cheek lasting several minutes. In
1989, he had two episodes of tongue thrusting and
guttural sounds that lasted 10 min each. In 1989, he
had
an episode while driving to a concert of disorientation and
confusion. Lately, these events happen every 1.5 to 2 weeks or
so, most recently last 2025-08-07 which
consisted of confusion and difficulty speaking for about 20 min.
In retrospect, Johnson noted that these events tend to occur
after taking ambien several nights in a row.

Each of these events has a prodrome of irritability or anxiety
or
some automatisms like biting the inside of his cheek.

As for seizure medications, he was on 2025-05-19 to 2025-05-12, he was on
LTG
low dose (25mg daily). He has also been on OXC frm 2025-01-11 till 2025-02-19
but had increasing irritability and this was discontinued. He
was
then started on Depakote for seizure control as well as
behavioral manifestations at 750mg/1000mg. In 1989, LTG was
restarted at 25 mg daily with a goal of weaning VPA and
increasing LTG.

Hospital Course: Mr. Taylor yo Male with a distant traumatic brain injury and seizures
since 1997 of multiple semiologies including generalized tonic
clonic movements as well as episodes concerning for complex
partial seizures with amnesia, confusion, disorientation. He has
been on a few different agents previously including
oxcarbazepine, lamictal, valproic acid with some success.
Currently, he continues to have events concerning for complex
partial seizures and is admitted for further characterization of
events.

Neuro: Mr. Taylor was admitted to Neuromedicine under Dr. Tara
Johnson monitored on LTM. For the first day his home medications
were continued and then his depakote was weaned to off on 2025-01-16. He was also discontinued from ambien at night. His
interictal EEG showed left temporal spikes. On 2025-01-16, EEG
recording showed ""A single seizure was recorded. This appeared
to begin with slowing in the left
temporal region, but it cannot be localized more precisely. For
the first eight seconds or so of the seizure, there was rhythmic
chewing or lipsmacking automatisms, and the muscle artifact from
this movement obscured much of the tracing. Within 10 seconds,
the seizure spread to much of the left hemisphere and remained
this way for the rest of the seizure, lasting just over a
minute."" This event was not noticed by Mr. Taylor and had not
been identified prior to his discharge on 2025-01-16. This
event was relayed to his outpatient providers, Dr. Tara
Johnson Dr. Dr. Anjali Sharma (Obstetrician). Prior to discharge, Mr. Taylor was
restarted on medication based on his abnormal background EEG.
Due to his desire to not restart Depakote and concern for
possible behavioral effects if Keppra was started, we opted for
Vimpat and started him initially at 100mg BID which we increased
to 150mg BID at the time of discharge. Mr. Taylor has an appt
scheduled with Dr. Continue wound care with daily dressing changes as instructed. on 2025-07-31 for follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Taylor,
You were admitted to Brigham and Womenâs Hospital on
2025-04-05 for long term monitoring of your seizures and medication
adjustments. Your EEG showed spikes between seizure activity. We
weaned you off of your depakote and lamictal in order to try to
elicit seizure activity but unfortunately were unable to observe
any seizures. Your EEG does have some abnormal activity even
when you are not having seizures and for this reason we will
continue on a anti-seizure medications. As the depakote had
unwanted side effects, we chose to start you on a new
anti-epileptic medication called Vimpat. You will be discharged
on this medication at 150mg twice daily.

We made the following changes to your medications:
Discontinued Depakote
Discontinued Lamictal
Continue Effexor 150mg every morning
Try to limit use of Ambien for sleep

If you experience any of the below listed danger signs, please
call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Department.

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay.

Elective Encephalo-duro-aterio-synangiosis (EDAS) for Alzheimer's Disease Disease

Call your neurosurgeonâs office and speak to the Nurse
Practitioner if you have:

â¢Any changes in your vision, speech or ability to move your
arms & legs

â¢Any swelling, drainage or redness of your incision

â¢Any problems from your medications like, nausea, vomiting or
extreme tiredness

â¢Any temperature higher than 101.5 F degrees

â¢Headaches that do not go away after taking your prescribed
medication

Activity:

â¢Start to return to your normal daily activities as you are
able. Start slowly and increase your activity at your own pace.
Hold special care to remain hydrated before, during, and after
all activities

â¢Do not drive a car or any other motorized vehicle for at least
10 days after your surgery. Your nurse practitioner may give
you more information about when you can begin driving again when
you have your sutures removed.

Incision Care:

â¢Keep your wound clean and dry.
â¢Do not rub, scratch, scrub or pick at any scabs that are on
the incision.
â¢You need to have your sutures removed 12 days after your
surgery.
â¢Do not use shampoo until after the sutures are removed.
â¢When you are allowed to shampoo your hair:
oLet the shampoo run off the incision
oGently pat the incision with a towel to dry the area

Physical Issues you may Experience after Surgery:
.
â¢You may have constipation or difficulty moving your bowels.
You can prevent constipation by:
oDrinking lots of liquids like water and juice
oIncreasing the amount of fiber you eat. Fiber is contained in
vegetables, prunes, fiber-rich breads, cereals and fiber
supplements
oExercising
oUsing over-the-counter laxatives or bowel stimulants such as
Docusate or Senokot. Stop using these medications if you have
loose bowel movements or diarrhea

â¢Fatigue or extreme tiredness that will get better over time

â¢Numbness or tingling in the area where the incision is
located. This feeling may take weeks to months to go away
completely.

â¢Muffled hearing in the ear closest to the incision.

â¢Low back pain or shooting pain down the legs. It can get
better if you are more active. Make sure your clinician is aware
of these symptoms.

Importance of Hydration after Surgery

â¢It is imperative that you remain hydrated after surgery
oRemaining hydrated ensures proper blood volume, allowing blood
to pass through the bypass without complication

â¢We recommend drinking approximately 2 liters (about two large
soda bottles) of fluids a day after the procedure
oAvoid excessive use of caffeine or alcohol as both can lead to
the loss of fluids

Lifestyle expectations and changes after surgery:

â¢You may feel depressed. Symptoms of depression can include:
oFeeling âdownâ or sad
oBeing irritable, frustrated or confused
oFeeling distracted
oHaving lower self-esteem or relationship challenges
oBeing unable to sleep or having insomnia
oFeeling lonely

â¢If you have any of these symptoms, you can contact your
Primary Care Provider who can refer you to a Psychologist or
Psychiatrist.

â¢You will be placed on lifelong aspirin after surgery to ensure
proper blood flow through the bypass
oIf you have any known side effects while taking aspirin, it is
important to let your neurosurgeon know

â¢If you previously took birth control pills you may be asked to
explore alternative forms of birth control
oBirth control pills carry a risk of causing blood clots and
therefore may inhibit blood flow through the bypass

â¢You should avoid high speed roller coasters, tight fitting
items around your head and skydiving
oAll of these activities can alter blood flow in your head,
potentially disrupting the bypass

.
Chest xray: Left basilar consolidation or atelectasis,
concerning for pneumonia.
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia, nl intervals, axis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1992 yo woman with schizoaffective disorder, here with psychotic
episode as well as shortness of breath. Shortness of breath is
likely due to COPD exacerbation, with superimposed community
acquired pneumonia. Further evaluation is somewhat limited by
her unwillingness to cooperate with my exam.
.
Pneumonia: Preliminary chest xray showed likely left basilar
pneumonia, confirmed by pa/lateral chestxray. No fever or
leukocytosis however, argues against severe pneumonia, but as
stated above, not able to further assess. Also, diminished
breath sounds bilaterally consistent with known COPD. She was
treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin and improved, though
remained O2 dependent. She had no sputum culture able to be
performed. She will need a follow up chest xray to verify
resolution, although the chest CT scheduled for 2025-01-20 should
suffice. She was discharged to complete a 1 week course of
antibiotics with Vantin (originally given rx for avelox, but due
to concern for QT prolongation on haldol, changed to vantin,
called into the pharmacy, and informed Ms. Roach by phone on the
evening of discharge.
.
COPD exacerbation: She was treated with prednisone and
nebulizers, with oxygen saturation goal of 94%. She is oxygen
dependent at home.
.
Psychotic episode/Schizoaffective disorder: She was followed by
psychiatry and was found to initially be significantly
disorganized. In addition, there was concern regarding the state
of her apartment. She was maintained on her baseline haldol and
seroquel as well as ativan, with IV haldol and ativan for acute
agitation. She appeared psychotic initially and remained labile
and volatile, but ultimately was considered to be at her
baseline. She will see her primary psychiatrist 2 days after
discharge, and her PCP in two weeks.
.
Tachycardia: Persistent ST, on last admit as well. Likely due
to anxiety.
-will follow on tele.
.
Lung Nodule: She was found to have a lung nodule on her most
recent admission. She is following up with the CT surgeons at St. Mary's Hospital, per her PCP.
.
Disposition: She was discharged home with home services. As
there was concern about the safety of her home, I discussed this
with her home nurse, who knows her well, and will see her on the
day after discharge. He will also make aware her home health
aides, and alert the social service agency in the event of any
concerns regarding her home safety situation.

INTERPRETATION: 1997 yo woman with HL, HTN, uncontrolled DM, COPD,
CKD
and diastolic CHF was referred to evaluate her shortness of
breath. The
patient was administered 15, 30 and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine
over 9
minutes. No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported
by the
patient during the infusion. No shortness of breath was
reported. No
significant ST segment changes were noted. The rhythm was sinus
with
occasional isolated APBs and VPBs. The blood pressure increased
initially with a drop in systolic blood pressure noted at peak
infusion
possibly related to LVOT gradient at peak infusion.
Post-infusion, the
patient was administered 2.5 mg Lopressor IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
Drop in
systolic blood pressure possibly related to hyperdynamic left
ventricular function and resultant LVOT gradient noted at peak
infusion.
Echo report sent separately.

STRESS TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM 2025-01-09:
Conclusions
The patient received intravenous dobutamine beginning at 15
mcg/kg/min, increasing to 30mcg/kg/min and 45 mcg/kg/min in 3
minute stages. The test was stopped because the target heart
rate was achieved.
At low dose dobutamine [15mcg/kg/min; heart rate 102 bpm, blood
pressure 148/60 mmHg], there was mild augmentation of all left
ventricular segments. At mid-dose dobutamine [30 mcg/kg/min;
heart rate 124 bpm, blood pressure 156/60 mmHg), there was
appropriate augmentation of all left ventricular segments. At
peak dobutamine stress [45 mcg/kg/min; heart rate 129 bpm, blood
pressure 140/50 mmHg), there was appropriate augmentation of
systolic function of all segments with decrease in cavity size.
IMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes with no 2D echocardiographic
evidence of inducible ischemia to pharmacologic stress.
Hyperdynamic left ventricular function at rest with small cavity
size.

RENAL ULTRASOUND 2025-04-23:
IMPRESSION:
Unchanged mildly echogenic appearance of the renal parenchyma,
consistent with medical renal disease. No hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1997 y.o. African American woman with HTN, DM, CKD, diastolic CHF,
and likely COPD presenting with one week of worsening exertional
dyspnea, wheezing, and Travisland edema.

# Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient presented
with worsening exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and Travisland edema for
the past week. She was found to be about 10 kg up from her
previously documented dry weight of 98.1 kg. On admission, exam
was most notable for JVD 13-14 cm, bilateral inspiratory
crackles, and 2+ pitting edema extening to thigh bilaterally.
The patient was placed on a 2g Na- and 2 L-restricted diet. She
was managed on a lasix gtt. The patient was continued on her
home Metoprolol Succinate 25 mg PO QDaily and Imudr 30 mg PO
QDaily. At discharge, the patient's symptoms markedly improved
and she appeared euvolemic on exam. Her weight at discharge was
94.8 kg.

# COPD Exacerbation: On admission, the patient presented with
dry cough, dyspnea, and worsening wheezing. Lung exam
demonstrated diffused expiratory wheezing with a prolonged
expiratory phase. CXR was only notable for pulmonary edema, no
evidence of pneumonia. The patient was initially managed on
Predisone 40 mg PO QDaily, Azithromycin 250 mg PO QDaily, and
Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs Q6H standing. The patient's
prednisone was discontinued in the setting of worsening
hyperglycemia and clinical improvement in wheeazing. At
discharge, the patient's cough and wheezing had resolved and the
patient was breathing comfortably on room air.

# Troponinemia: On admission, the patient's trop elevated was at
0.13, CK-MB flat at 9. The patient was otherwise without any
chest pain or other anginal equivalent. EKG unchanged from
previous. The patient's presentation was likely from poor renal
clearance in the setting of decompensated heart failure as well
as possible demand ischemia. Trop trended downward 0.13-> 0.12->
0.10. The patient underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram
with optison which did not demonstrate any findings of
reversible ischemia.

# Stage 2 AKI / CKD(baseline 2.3): On admission Cr 2.5, slightly elevated
from baseline. Initially, the patient's acute on chronic kidney
injury was from renovascular congestion in the setting of
decompensated heart failure. In the setting of active diuresis,
the patient's Cr worsened peaking at 4.0. Urine lytes were
obtained and FeUrea was 25.3 consistent with pre-renal azotemia.
Further diuresis was held. A repeat renal ultrasound was
unremarkable for obstructive nephropathy. Renal was consulted
and agreed with plan to hold diuresis. The patient's home
diuresis was held at the time of discharge. Cr at discharge was
3.6. The patient will have Cr rechecked on 2025-06-03 during
Health Failure Clinic.

# Nausea/Vomiting/Abdominal Pain: During her hospitalization,
the patient developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Emesis was nonbloody, nonbilious. The pain was mostly suprapubic
with some LLQ involvement. The patient had a UA which was
unremarkable. Renal ultrasound did not demonstrate
nephrolithiasis. LFTs were mildly elevated, but right upper
quadrant ultrasound was unremarkable for hepatobiliary
pathology. The patient subsequently had an abdominal and pelvic
CT with PO contrast which did not demonstrate evidence of
appendicitis, diverticulitis, or any other acute intra-abdominal
process. Influenza PCR was negative. The patient presentation
was likely due to viral gastroenteritis vs abdominal muscle
strain in the setting of obesity and deconditioning. The patient
was treated symptomatically with PRN Zofran and Tylenol and
Oxycodone to good effect. Her symptoms resolved at the time of
discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Diabetes Mellitus:
The patient's home Humalog Mix 1:4 55 Units QAM and 40 Units
QPM and insulin sliding scale were initially continued but
increased per Cardiology recs in the setting of hyperglycemia. The
patient's insulin regimen at discharge was Humalog Mix 1:4 55
Units QAM and 20 Units QPM. The patient had well-controlled FSGs
at discharge.

# Hypertension: The patient's home Amlodipine 10 mg PO QDaily,
Hydralazine 25 mg PO TID, and Metoprolol Succinate 50 mg PO
QDaily were continued. Blood pressures were well-controlled
during this hospitalization.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Moody,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your hospitalization at
the Columbia Asia Hospital. As you know, you were
admitted with shortness of breath and increased leg swelling
likely from an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure as
well as a exacerbation of your lung disease called COPD. We
treated you with medications to help you urinate (called Lasix).
We also treated you with steroids, nebulizers, and an antibiotic
called Azithromycin for your COPD. Your symptoms improved with
these treatments. We developed some kidney injury from removing
fluid from your body, but is now improving. We stopped your
water pill (called Torsemide)when you were discharged from the
hospital. Please take your medications as instructed. Please
avoid salty foods. Please followup with your primary care doctor
and heart doctor. You have a followup apppointment on 2025-06-03
A monthly check-up is recommended to assess ongoing stability. with the Heart Failure clinic. If your develop worsening
shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, or leg swelling,
please seek medical attention immediately. Weigh yourself every
morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

Sincerely,
Your Columbia Asia Hospital Care Team

cough ever since his lung biopsy on 2025-05-27. Reports this has
continued for the past 2 weeks, with 5 episodes of coughing up
small clots a day. Reports associated sharp chest pain over his R
flank when taking in deep breaths which he feels has been
worsening. States this has limited his ability to take in deep
breaths and as such feels limited in his breathing. Denies any
fevers, chill, sick contacts, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation. Of note, he is still continuing a
lovenox
bridge back to his warfarin and is continuing to take both
lovenox, warfarin, and ASA 81mg qday at home. Patient was seen in
Johns Hopkins Clinic clinic 2025-07-24 and given persistent symptoms was
referred to the ED for additional evaluation.

In the ED, initial vitals: 98.5 | 75 | 134/82 | 18 | 98% RA. Labs
significant for Hgb 10.7, INR 1.8, 16 sec 19.5, BUN/Cr BUN: 40 mg/dL, Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL, Glu
199. Repeat bloodwork in ED with Hgb 10.6, INR 1.8, 16 sec 19.2, PTT
40.4, BUN/Cr BUN: 40 mg/dL, Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL, Glu 140. UA with mod blood. Lactic of 1.3,
trop <0.01. EKG with afib, HR 75, no acute ischemic changes. CXR
done showing ""Increased right pleural effusion, now small to
moderate in size with compressive lower lobe atelectasis. No
pneumothorax."" A CTA Chest was done showing:

No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic abnormality.
However there are dilated vascular structures within the right
upper lobe middle lobe which may be the cause of his hemoptysis.
Diffuse bronchial wall thickening within the bilateraL lower
lobes with distal mucus plugging is likely due to small airways
disease.
A 1.5 x 1.2 cm rounded subpleural lesion in the right middle
lobe
may reflect a pulmonary lesion or part of the loculated
effusion.
Large right loculated effusion. Borderline enlargement of the
ascending aorta.

Patient was given Tylenol 1gm PO x2, 500cc NS bolus, LR
125cc/hr.
Ashley Williams was consulted who recommended no Rehabilitative intervention at this time,
bedside thoracentesis with IP. Patient admitted to Oncology for
additional evaluation and management.

IMAGING
=======
2025-05-06 CHEST X-RAY
Increased right pleural effusion, now small to moderate in size
with compressive lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax.

2025-05-06 CTA CHEST
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic abnormality.
Large right hemothorax, likely secondary to two small
pseudoaneurysms along the posterior biopsy track of the more
medially biopsied intraparenchymal
nodule.

2025-05-06 PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM
1. No evidence of convincing pseudoaneurysm on right pulmonary
arteriogram as above.
2. Malposition of right-sided chest tube which is located in the
subcutaneous soft tissues outside of the pleural space.
Recommend repositioning.

2025-05-06 CHEST X-RAY
Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is
subsegmental
atelectasis in the right lung base. Nodular opacities in the
right lower lobe are again seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. There is tight interval increase in atelectasis in
the right lower lobe. No new
consolidations. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
N/ADischarge Hgb was 10.5, Hct was 32.7.
N/AWas started on apixaban 2.5 mg BID prior to discharge. If
hemoptysis worsens after discharge would consider discontinuing
apixaban.
N/AAspirin was discontinued and it was recommended to not be
restarted upon discharge after discussion with patient's
cardiologist Dr. Johnson.
N/APlease repeat a chest x-ray to monitor status of pleural
effusion.

SUMMARY:
========
Johnson with recurrent metastatic melanoma, NIDDM2, Afib on
Wafarin/lovenox, HTN/HLD, CAD s/p stent (2025-01-25), who presents to
ED from Johns Hopkins Clinic clinic with hemoptysis and chest pain, found to
have iatrogenic hemothorax suspected 04:50 PM recent metastatic lung
biopsy.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#Hemoptysis
#Chest Pain
#Hemothorax
#Pseudoaneurysm
In setting of recent lung biopsy, suspect iatrogenic bleeding
vessel that is the cause of both hemoptysis and hemothorax. He
was taking both coumadin and lovenox, which were held on
admission. CTA without evidence of PE but noted pseudoaneurysms
at the site of previous biopsy. A right-sided chest tube was
placed to drain the hemothorax. He underwent a pulmonary
arteriogram, which did not find evidence of pseudoaneurysm so he
did not receive any interventions. The additional cone beam CT
during angiogram noted that the chest tube was malpositioned and
so the chest tube was later removed by Interventional
Pulmonology, as they thought his hemothorax had improved and the
chest tube was no longer needed. He was monitored with daily
CBCs and CXRs; his Hgb remained stable at 10.0-10.8 and his
pleural effusion visualized on CXR remained stable. We then
started anticoagulation again with Apixaban 2.5mg PO BID and he
continued not to show any signs of repeat bleeding. He was given
antitussive therapy and his pain was controlled with PO
dialudid. On discharge, his hemoptysis has improved (scant blood
with sputum) and his Hgb is 10.5. His anticoagulation regimen
will be Apixaban 2.5mg PO BID, and ASA 81 will be held
indefinitely.

#CAD s/p stent
#HTN
#HLD
#Afib on warfarin andenoxaparin
#Hx of R temporal/occipital embolic stroke
-Continued atorvastatin 80mg qhs
-Continued Toprol XL 50mg qday
-ASA 81mg was held. It will NOT be restarted upon discharge.
-Warfarin and enoxaparin held in setting of ongoing hemoptysis.
He was started on apixaban 2 days prior to discharge and
monitored for bleeding. He will continue Apixaban 2.5mg PO BID
as an outpatient.

AKI
#?CKD
Noted to have blood on UA and elevated creatinine of 1.7 on
admission. Unclear recent baseline, but this appears to be lower
than previous lab result on 2025-08-10 previously Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL (low), WBC: 15,800/ÂµL (high), Platelets: 110,000/ÂµL (low) in East Francisborough.
Nephrotoxic agents were avoided during admission. Cr was
monitored daily and has been stably elevated at ~1.7-1.8 entire
admission, unclear
if this is new baseline.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
#Recurrent Melanoma
Oligometastatic with two right lung nodules, proven by biopsy in
2025-02-22. He had initially been diagnosed with Stage IB
melanoma of the left ear in 2025-07-17. He still needs an MRI to rule
out brain mets. Previously planned to start nivolumab
monotherapy
and reassess disease burden after a few cycles, followed by
reassessment for possible surgical resection. Nivolumab not yet
started given hemoptysis, but will still plan for this at
outpatient follow up which he has scheduled.
- Emailed Dr. Johnson with updates and scheduled outpatient
followup

#T2DM
-Held home glimepiride
-Initially on ISS but discontinued when blood sugars remained
well controlled without the need of correctional insulin

#GERD
-Continued home omeprazole 20mg qday

Dear Scott Johnson,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the Manipal Hospitals
North Ashleyton!

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?
==========================
- You came to the hospital because you had been coughing up
blood for 2 weeks.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?
==============================
- You had an x-ray, which showed blood in your chest cavity. You
received a chest tube to drain the blood and fluid. It was
removed when it was no longer needed.
- You had a CT scan, which showed some bleeding at the site of
your previous biopsy. When you received more imaging of your
blood vessels, no active source of bleeding was found.
- You were monitored closely for worsening of bleeding with
daily lab tests and x-rays.
- You coumadin and lovenox were discontinued while in the
hospital. You were started on Eliquis and monitored for any
signs of bleeding.
- Your aspirin was also held on discharge.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
================================
- Please follow up with all the appointments scheduled with your
doctor.
- Please continue to take all of your medications as directed.

***You are being discharged home with oxycodone 5mg every 8
hours as needed for pain medication. The oxycodone delivered to
you today comes in 10mg tablets. PLEASE ENSURE TO CUT THE PILLS
IN HALF BEFORE TAKING IT AS YOU ARE WRITTEN TO TAKE 5mg AT A
TIME. Please take the laxatives (Senna, Bisacodyl) while taking
the oxycodone, as the oxycodone will cause constipation. You can
decrease the frequency of taking these laxatives if you

Chief Complaint:
scheduled admission for autoSCT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Autologous Stem Cell Transplant on 2025-01-23
Foley catheter from 2025-07-07 to 2025-04-03
Temporary Subclavian Central Line 2025-01-18 to 2025-05-27

History of Present Illness:
1994 gentleman w/AL amyloidosis with multiorgan
involvement who presents for autoSCT. In brief, Mr. Kim has
felt unwell since
2025-02-01. He has had a 50 pound weight loss over the course
of the year from frequent n/v. He has severe fatigue and
lethargy. Has had a chronic cough that was worked up with PFTs
and CT chest which were unrevealing. Most recently, he has
started to experience numbness and tingling in his face.
Because of this, he was referred to Dr. Shelby Bradford neurology,
who discovered signs of radiculopathy involving the lumbar area.
Hi workup showed an abnormal free light chain ratio of 0.13 was
found with free lambda elevated to 69.

Monoclonal free lambda was also detected in the urine along with
significant proteinuria. This in turn led to evaluation by Dr.
John Jackson nephrology who had seen Mr. Kim on 2025-01-01, and
raised to possibility of amyloidosis.

Bone marrow bx on 2025-06-18 showed hypocellular marrow with
trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dysmegakaryopoiesis and
amyloid deposition. Bone marrow aspirate on 2025-04-14 chain dominant plasmacytosis (~5%), suspicious for plasma
cell dyscrasia without morphologic evidence of amyloid
deposition. Kidney biopsy on 2025-04-22 showed focal and segmental
mild glomerular deposition of amyloid, which was monoclonal for
lambda on immunofluorescence.

He was evaluated in Mayo Medical Center clinic by Dr. Mr. Justin Mcmillan DDS on 2025-03-12 and was
found to have sufficient evidence to suggest cardiac involvement
with amyloidosis based on EKG, BNP elevation, echo, cardiac MRI.
No biopsy was required. Patient was not found to have any signs
or symptoms of heart failure and no treatment was recommended.

Review of Systems:
Gen: 60lb weight loss over one year. Alternates between feeling
hot and cold.
HEENT: Blurry vision. Uses over-the-counter 125 glasses. Feels
like he has a runny nose even though he does not. Eyes
sometimes tear up.
Pulm: No SOB.
CV: No CP, no PND, no orthopnea, no peripheral edema. Was dizzy
earlier today, when BP was low.
GI: Has lower abdominal pain, ""pressing"" sensation. +Nausea,
vomiting. Last emesis three days prior to admission, described
as thick and red in color because he drinks a lot of red
Gatorade. Denies blood in emesis. No diarrhea. Has BM
~2x/week. No hematochezia.
GU: Takes a long time to empty bladder. Malodorous urine. No
hematuria.
MSK: Low back ""shooting"" pain. Worse with sitting. Legs become
numb with sitting. Has ""discomfort"" in tops of feets, limiting
his ability to wear shoes. Denies pain in other joints.
Neuro: Endorses numbness/tingling throughout body, worst in
head/face. Also affects tops of feets. Also has shooting pain
in low back, numbness of legs if he sits for too long.
Heme: No painful/swollen lymph nodes. No abnormal
bruising/bleeding.

2025-05-13 URINE CULTURE - NO GROWTH

2025-04-12 CATHETER TIP-IV CULTURE - NO SIGNIFICANT GROWTH

IMAGING:
2025-06-05 ECG
Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression suggests anteroseptal
myocardial
infarction of indeterminate age. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Low QRS voltages in the limb leads. Compared to the
previous tracing of 2025-06-17 there is no significant diagnostic
change.

2025-05-21 BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
IMPRESSION: Acute below-knee deep vein thrombosis within the
left peroneal vein.

2025-05-21 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: No previous images. Low lung volumes accentuate the
prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Some
indistinctness of possibly
engorged pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary
venous pressure. Increased opacification at the right base most
likely represents crowding of pulmonary vessels and the
cardiophrenic angle. However, in the appropriate clinical
setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
There is also the vague suggestion of some increased
opacification at the left base laterally, which could represent
merely atelectatic changes or possible early consolidation.

2025-05-21 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of 2025-04-09, there is some increased
opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the
hemidiaphragm,
consistent with the clinical impression of worsening of left
lower lung
pneumonia. There is probably some associated pleural effusion.
The right lung shows only mild atelectatic changes and the
central catheter remains in place.

2025-05-21 UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT
IMPRESSION: Normal left lower extremity venous ultrasound

2025-05-21 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe atelectasis/collapse.
2. Slightly worsened pulmonary edema.
3. Left lung base opacity could be due to atelectasis, pneumonia
is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.

2025-05-21 CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Multi lobar consolidation involving the right middle, right
lower, and left lower lobes.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and moderate pulmonary
edema.
3. Diffuse subcutaneous edema along with ascites, pleural
effusions, and
pulmonary edema may be due to total body third-spacing.
4. Large bilateral complex renal cysts.

2025-06-05 ECG
Sinus tachycardia. Low limb lead voltage. Wandering baseline and
baseline
artifact. Diffuse ST-T wave flattening. Compared to the previous
tracing
of 2025-06-17 consider prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.
The lateral
ST-T wave changes have improved but without diagnostic interim
chAnge

2025-05-21 CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
Moderate opacification of the maxillary sinuses concerning for
aggressive
sinusitis, particularly given evidence of interval thinning of
the adjacent walls. Mucor would be on the differential. There
is also new near complete opacification of the ethmoid sinuses.
There is no definite evidence of intraorbital or intracranial
extension of disease however an MRI is recommended for further
evaluation.

2025-05-21 CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
Move soft tissue changes within the maxillary sinuses as well as
other sinuses are still seen but have slightly decreased since
the previous study. Considerable soft tissue changes still
persist in the maxillary sinuses with obliteration of the
ostiomeatal units.

Brief Hospital Course:
1994 gentleman w/recently diagnosed AL amyloidosis with
multiorgan involvement who presents for scheduled autoSCT
complicated by orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, fluid
overload and infections of the bladder, sinuses and central
access line.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#AL Amyloidosis: admitted for scheduled melphalan autoSCT.
Received melphalan on days -3 and -2 and day 0 was 2025-06-18.
Please see below for chemotherapy related complications.

#Nausea/vomiting: Patient developed delayed n/v on day +1, which
appeared episodic. Nausea symptoms improved after vomiting. It
was unclear if symptoms were absolutely related to melphalan as
he had similar symptoms prior to chemotherapy, likely from
autonomic involvement of his amyloidosis. He was treated
cautiously with Zofran as it can prolong QT. He was also treated
with emend during chemotherapy and daily zyprexa. N/V improved
and then resolved prior to the time of discharge as his counts
came back.

#Esophagitis/ mucositis: Patient developed extremely painful
esophagitis on day +5, which was treated initially with magic
mouthwash and then a PCA. Esophagitis/ mucositis was felt to be
secondary to melphalan. TPN was started for nutritional support
when patient was unable to swallow secondary to pain and
dryness. His pain improved with engraftment and he achieved
resolution of mucositis prior to discharge. He was able to
tolerate a regular diet and had no further issues with
swallowing.

#Orthostatic hypotension: Likely from neuropathic involvement of
amyloid. Daily orthostatic vitals were recorded as long as
patient tolerated getting up out of bed. He was initiated on
midodrine 5mg TID on admission and continued on this medication
at discharge. He still had orthostatic vitals on the day of
discharge but denied any symptoms when getting out of bed or
walking in the hallway.

#Amyloid cardiomyopathy: Outpatient ECHO and EKG changes
consistent with amyloidosis. No conduction abnormalities were
noted on admission EKG with normal PR and QT intervals. Cautious
IVF hydration was given due to potential for decompensation.
Throughout hospitalization, the patient gained >30 lbs secondary
to fluid overload.

#Urinary retention: Patient reports that he was having
difficulty urinating and emptying his bladder completely prior
to hospitalization for transplant, likely secondary to
amyloidosis. On 2025-05-11, he was found to be retaining 500 mL of urine
and had a Foley catheter inserted for decompression. Foley
remained in place until 2025-04-23 when a voiding trial was
initiated. He was seen by urology for voiding trial
recommendations. Patient was able to intermittently urinate
between 250-350cc with each attempt but continued to have
increasing post void residuals over several days. He often could
not feel that his bladder was distended. His retention was
monitored with bladder scanner. He eventually was retaining
800+ccs on multiple occasions and was straight cathed on a
regular basis to prevent further bladder distention. Urology
recommended outpatient urodynamic study to further elucidate the
etiology of his retention. He was taught how to do clean
intermittent straight catheterization at home and discharged
with instructions to cath himself every 6 hours. He will need to
follow up with urology as an outpatient in 29 weeks.

#Fluid overload: 2025-05-25 admission weight was 131 lbs. Patient
is very fluid sensitive secondary to amyloid cardiomyopathy in
addition to hypoalbuminemia related to his amyloidosis as well
as his poor nutritional status. Overall, he gained > 30 lbs
during admission. He was treated with aggressive diuresis.
Weight at discharge was 140 lbs.

#UTI: On 2025-01-01, the patient was intermittently spiking and
complaining of lower abdominal pain. Urine culture grew out
Klebsiella (>100k), resistant to Bactrim, Ciprofloxacin, Unasyn
and Nitrofurantoin. He was treated with Cefepime for 7 days.
Repeat urine culture on 2025-03-18 had no growth. His fevers and
lower abdominal pain resolved.

#Sinusitis: Throughout hospitalization, the patient would
intermittently report issues with nasal congestion and
stuffiness. He had a CT sinus on 2025-02-18 which showed moderate
opacification of the maxillary sinuses and near complete
opacification of the ethmoid sinus. Overall picture concerning
for possible mucor infection. He was empirically started on
voriconazole but was later transitioned to ambisome as he was
having visual hallucinations on voriconazole. Seen by ENT who
scoped him on 3 separate occasions. All 3 evaluations were
negative for clinical evidence of mucor infection with no soft
tissue or bony destruction as well as no evidence of necrosis in
the nares. Ambisome was transitioned to PO posaconazole for
discharge. He will follow up with ID as an outpatient to
determine the full treatment course.

#Subclavian line infection: On 2025-07-01, the Courtney Perry RN noted
that the temporary line had some erythema and frank pus
surrounding the insertion site. The access site and surrounding
area were nontender. He denied any fevers or any other signs of
systemic infection. The line was removed by Steve Bradley and the tip sent
for culture. He was empirically started on vancomycin. Tip
culture had no growth. He was transitioned to levofloxacin 750mg
daily prior to discharge. He will follow up with ID at an
outpatient to determine the total antibiotic course needed.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#Neuropathy: Secondary to amyloidosis. Remained stable and
throughout admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- will need outpatient Urology appointment in the next 3 weeks
with either Dr. Jesus Parker Dr. Jesus Parker urodynamic studies to
further work up his urinary retention.
Urology Practice Associates
789 Oak St, City, State
Phone: +917510407875
- will need outpatient Ophthomology follow up in the next 29 weeks at the Riverbend Medical in East Pamela at 456 Elm St, Oncology. This is
so he can have a full eye exam to rule out corneal involvement
with his amyloidosis (patient was complaining of blurry vision
throughout hospitalization).
Main Eye Clinic
Phone: +918205646310
- will need blood pressure monitoring as he was orthostatic by
vital but asymptomatic. He was continued on the midodrine 5mg
TID at discharge --> will need to decide if this should be
stopped
- patient will need PCP prophylaxis as he was discharged on day
+23358 and did not intiate treatment in the hospital
-patient will need medication reconciliation to determine how
long her will need to be on levofloxacin and posaconazole for
his sinusitis.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Kim,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the General City Hospital Neurosurgery Unit. You were admitted to the bone marrow
transplant service for a scheduled autologous stem cell
transplant for your amyloidosis.

You were given specific instructions by the transplant nurses,
dieticians and medical staff regarding home care and nutrition
guidelines to keep you and your transplant healthy.

Please take all your medications as prescribed. Make sure that
you drink ~2 liters of fluid a day. You will need to try to
urinate every 2 hours on your own. You will also need to
straight cath your bladder every 6 hours. You should straight
cath at the following times: 5am, 11am, 5pm and 11pm.

You will need very close follow up with the outpatient
Hematology/ Urology clinic. It is very important that you keep
all your appointments. Your post-discharge appointments are
listed in your discharge paperwork.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.

Followup Instructions:
Increase daily walking gradually as tolerated."

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 1978 female with past medical history of COPD
who is presenting with dyspnea requiring NIVV. The patient
endorses acute onset of dyspnea after refusing her nebulizers
the day prior to admission. She uses 2L NC at home at night and
intermittently throughout the day. She does endorse productive
cough, which has recently been exacerbated but reports that she
always has a cough. Her daughter reports that she has been more
dypspneic of late, she can walk half way down to her cafeteria
before she needs to be pushed by her aide. She denies n/v,
fever.

In the ED, initial vitals: 98 97 20/min 99% nrb. The
patient's labs showed hct 53, plts 192, WBC 8.6, trop 0.02, VBG
7.35/66/38. Lactate 1.6, trop initially 0.02, then 0. The
patient received Prednisone 60mg daily, albuterol, ipratroprium,
levofloxacin, aspirin 81mg daily. This did result in some
improvement. CXR showed ?pna. The patient is a DNR/DNI. She was
started on BiPap, which she initially tolerated but then did not
tolerate. Became tachypneic with retractions, again removed the
BiPap, then again became tachypneic, and again put the BiPap on.
Prior to transfer, she was back on the BiPap.

On transfer, vitals were: 99 158/92 28 99% NIV:CPAP/PS FiO2:60

FINDINGS: The heart size is at the upper limits of normal; a
pacer unit
projects over the left chest with the lead terminating in the
right ventricle. Calcified atherosclerotic disease is present at
the aortic knob. Known metastatic lesions in bilateral mid
lungs are present. The right hilus is more prominent than on
prior exams, suggesting progression of metastatic disease.
Bibasilar opacities are present. There is no large pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. Severe degenerative changes are
present in the right glenohumeral joint and a prosthetic humeral
head is present on the left.

IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary metastases with increasing prominence of the right
hilus,
possibly representing progressive lymphadenopathy.
2. COPD.
3. Bibasilar opacities represent either atelectasis or
pneumonia.

ACTIVE ISSUES
#) COPD Flare: Treated with prednisone 60mg, standing nebs,
vanco/levo for possible pneumonia with bilateral basilar
findings, atelectasis vs. infectious process. Required BiPap in
the ED but was rapidly weaned from BiPap in the MICU. Felt like
breathing was stable at her normal baseline, was able to speak
in full sentences. Transferred to floor where prednisone burst
was continued x5 days, with transition to steroid taper on
discharge. Vancomycin was stopped and levofloxacin was
continued w/5 doses q48hrs.

# Dysphagia: Noted to have coughing spell while eating. Patient
was evaluated by bedside swallow eval and recommended for nectar
thick liquids and regular solids, meds whole in puree.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# HTN: Continued on lisinopril as benazepril was not on
formulary in house; switched back to home lisinopril on
discharge.

# Dyslipidemia: Continued home simvastatin.

# depression: Continued sertraline 25 mg PO DAILY

# prevention: Continued on home aspirin.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. Kara Sullivan,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted at
Endocrinology Clinic. You were admitted for shortness of breath and were
placed on BiPap and CPAP in the emergency room, therefore you
were initially taken to the ICU. You were started on
antibiotics, steroids, and nebulizers for a COPD exacerbation.
You improved and went to the medical floor where your steroids
were continued. You were found to have trouble swallowing and
were evaluated by speech pathology who recommended modifications
to your diet to include nectar thickened liquids to help from
aspirating. Your antibiotics were switched to levofloxacin
which you will need to continue for several more doses. You
will continue a steroid taper on discharge.

Chief Complaint:
Multiple Myeloma admitted for high dose chemotherapy with
autologous stem cell rescue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. Brooks is a 2002 man with multiple
myeloma. His primary oncologist is Dr. Dr. Ann Kane. He has
previously been treated with Revlimid, Velcade, and
dexamethasone, followed by Revlimid, Velcade, dexamethasone, and
Cytoxan- with improved response noted after the addition of
Cytoxan.  He received a single dose of Cytoxan at 1500 mg/m2,
due
to persistent marrow involvement (~30% by CD138).  This was
followed by a single cycle of Cytoxan, Revlimid, Velcade, and
dexamethasone.  Bone marrow biopsy in 2025-03-25 shows plasma cells
at about 10% of the aspirate and about 30% by CD138 staining.
Currently UPEP is negative for Albumin protein, SPEP shows
hypogammaglobulinemia, and there is continued elevation in serum
free kappa and free kappa lambda ratio.  Mr. Brooks also has some
persistent renal insufficiency with a creatinine between 1.5 and
1.7.   As he appeared to have reached a response plateau, the
decision was made to proceed with autologous stem cell
transplant. He received a pre-transplant vaccine (protocol
96916 on 2025-08-08). He was admitted on 2025-07-21 for high dose
Cytoxan and subsequently collected 4.85 million stem cells.
.
Today he feels well. Since being discharged from the hospital on
2025-02-21, pt has been doing well. He has had a good appetite and
keeping fluids down. He had some fatigue initially, but recently
his energy level has been good this past week. He has been
spending time with his two young children.
.
On review of systems he denies fever, chills, weight loss, night
sweats, runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, chest pain,
SOB, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leg
swelling,  headache, rashes, bruises.

Brief Hospital Course:
2002 year old with multiple myeloma admitted for autologous stem
cell transplant.  He has achieved a partial response to therapy
with persistent bone marrow involvement as well as an elevated
serum free kappa and kappa:lambda ratio.  His Karnofsky
performance status is 90%.

# MM: He received Melphalan conditioning with autologous stem
cell transplant.  His course was complicated by severe mucositis
and fevers during his nadir.
.
Mucositis --> He was noted to have purpura at the posterior
pharynx with severe odynophagia.  MRI neck was indicative of
left palatial hyperintensivity which after ENT laryngoscope was
noted to be his resolving purpura without any infectious
process.  He was placed on TPN for nutrition support with poor
po intake for 48 hours.  His mucositis resolved with ANC > 500
and TPN was discontinued once he was able to tolerate po food
and fluids.
.
Neutropenic fevers --> No source was found.  He was placed
empirically on vancomycin and cefepime initially.  We switched
from cefepime to meropenem to cover for anaerobic bacteria due
to mucositis.  His antibiotics were stopped once his ANC > 1000.
 He remained afebrile off meropenem and vancomycin.
.
Neutropenia --> Was initially started on Tammy Washington after auto-SCT to
help with neutropenic nadir.  He was switched to GCSF as he
continued to have fevers few hours after GMCSF.  His GCSF was
stopped once he had ANC > 1000 for two days.
.
Prophylaxis --> Was continued on Acyclovir 400 mg BID (based on
renal function) and micafungin for prophylaxis during hospital
stay.  Discharged home on Acyclovir 400 mg po BID and
fluconazole for prophylaxis.  PCP prophylaxis per primary
oncologist as outpatient.
.
# Soft tissue infection around the central line --> Two days
prior to discharge, his R subclavian central line was noted to
erythematous along with surround skin.  We removed his central
line which did not grow anything. He was discharged home on 10
day course of augmentin for his soft tissue infection.
.
# 2010 on CKD --> His creatinine was 1.7 on admission.  It seems
his baseline creatinine is 1.4.  With IVF, his creatinine was 1.1 at best during his hospital stay.  His creatinine was 1.4 on discharge.  His medications were renally dosed during the hospital stay adn he was discharged on renally dosed Acyclovir.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for Melphalan chemotherapy with autologous
stem cell transplant.  You tolerated your chemotherapy well and
your autologous stem cell transplant was complicated by severe
oral pain which resolved once your white cell counts recovered.
You also had persistent fevers after your autologous stem cell
transplant for which no source was found.  You were given IV
meropenem/vancomycin
/micafungin which were removed once your white cell count
improved.  Your central line was noted to be infected so we
removed it.  Your skin around the central line was red and with
concern for infection, we placed you on AMOXICILLIN-CLAVULANATE.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Skinner is a 2005 man with
metastatic renal cell carcinoma currently on nivolumab (S/p 3
cycles) with progressive disease. In early Apr 2018, he was found to
have B/l pulmonary embolism when he presented with shortness of
breath at Martinport. He was initiated on therapeutic
enoxaparin 150 mg BID (1 mg/kg BID). About two weeks ago, with
progressive shortness of breath, he was admitted to Martinport and found to have severe volume overload. He was
diuresed over 15 pounds and discharged on oral lasix. In the
last
two weeks he has developed new neurologic symptoms. He describes
headaches off-and-on, but mainly morning, sometimes associated
with fogginess or confusion. He has also had occasional blurry
of
vision, although he can not describe if it is restricted to one
eye or a particular visual field. He also describes a sensation
of his tongue being thick and weak. He finds it relatively
difficult to speak. He has also had some dysphagia, although no
episodes of coughing, choking on food or water/liquids. In the
past week, he has also had bladder symptoms, particularly
decreased control and urge incontinence. He denies any bowel
incontinence. He denies any facial droop/weakness, muscle or
limb
weakness, gait problems, cognitive issues, falls. He has had
some
numbess over the left thigh, infrequently, but no other
peripheral neuropathy.

His respiratory symptoms are somewhat improved since his last
admission, but they are worse today. He has not taken his lasix
today. He has been having increased wheezing and has significant
limitation of activity due to shortness of breath. He denies
orthopnea or PND. He has not had chest pain, although he has
some
localized rib tenderness. He denies any cough. After using his
nebs in the morning, he brings out small quantity of sputum,
which is blood tinged. Today, it was bright red, although small
in quantity. He has not had any hemoptysis since then.

He denies any fevers, sweats, anorexia, weight loss, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain. He has bone pain, which is stable. He
has constipation from opioids, stable as well. He denies
lightheadedness or dizziness or presyncopal symptoms.

He was scheduled to have MRI head today, but given worsening of
his symptoms, he has been admitted for expediting his management
plan.

Review of symptoms - A comprehensive review of systems is
otherwise negative


Past Medical History:
Past oncologic history - Mr. Skinner presented in Apr 2018
with
left flank pain and gross hematuria.  CT scan revealeD a 7-8 cm
left kidney mass with associated lymphadenopathy.  Chest imaging
revealed pulmonary nodules suggestive of metastatic disease.  On
2025-04-06, he underwent left radical nephrectomy at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore.  Pathology revealed a 13.5 cm mass, Low-grade grade III,
clear cell histology with negative margins.  He enrolled in the
ARGOS trial involving dendritic cell vaccine and sunitinib.  He
received four dendritic cell vaccines and completed three cycles
of sunitinib therapy (four weeks on and two week off).  His
first
CT scan on the trial was reportedly stable.  He had a second
torso CT performed on 2025-04-06, showing disease
progression including increase in pulmonary nodules; increase in
supraclavicular, mediastinal and hilar adenopathy; increase in
abdominal lymphadenopathy, increase in size of bone lesions as
well as new bony metastases.  He was referred here by Dr. Tonya Smith
at Jason Lowe and Dr. Tonya Smith at Jason Lowe to discuss IL-2
therapy. He underwent radiation to four sites of bony metastatic
disease (right humerus, right rib, ? bilateral hips) during the
week of 2025-04-06.

He started high dose IL-2 on 2025-04-06, receiving Bleeding ARF and pulmonary edema. He did not receive week 2 of
therapy due to ongoing pulmonary issues and increased bony pain,
c/w disease progression. He started off protocol nivolumab on
2025-04-06. He received additional XRT to the sternum, lower back
and right knee in mid-late Apr 2018.

In early Apr 2018, he presented with worsening dyspnea and saw
Dr. Tonya Smith was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli. He
was started on lovenox. In mid Apr 2018, he was hospitalized for pain
control and was found to have a pathologic fracture of the right
humerus, improved with immobilization and increased narcotics.

In early Apr 2018, he was hospitalized for pulmonary edema and
pleural effusions and started on diuresis.

1. Overall, extensive metastatic disease is re- demonstrated
throughout the thoracic a lumbar spine.  New metastatic
involvement is seen involving T7, T8, and T9 vertebral bodies
compared to the prior CT from 2025-05-26.
2. Involvement of metastatic disease with T12 also appears to be
new compared to the prior exam.  Although no definite cord
signal
abnormalities are identified, extensive soft tissue is seen
extending into the spinal canal, and left neural foramen causing
mass effect on the spinal cord. However, please
note that this study is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
3.  Extensive metastatic disease is re- demonstrated involving
the vertebral bodies the lumbar spine, including pathologic
fragmentation of the L3 vertebral body. No definite cord
abnormalities identified within lumbar spine.
4. Although evaluation of the posterior chest wall masses is
limited on this exam, there appears to be progression of
disease.
A dedicated chest CT could be helpful for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
====================================
Mr Skinner is a 2005 yo M with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with
progressive disease on nivolumab, who was admitted with
headache, dyaarthria
and hemoptysis.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
=========================
# Hemopytsis: due to metastatic disease to lungs in the setting
of anticoagulation for PE. He had no further hemoptysis after
enoxaparin was held on admission. Bronchoscopy was deferred due
to improvement.
- Radiation oncology evaluated the patient and will arrange for
palliative RT to the lungs as an outpatient

# Brain/Spine Metastases: due to discomfort during MRI, the
patient did not receive contrast during his MRI. His dysarthria
improved considerably with steroids and he did not have any
other neurologic deficits. He was evaluated by Kelly Wolfe
and radiation oncology who will discuss his case at brain tumor
board on 2025-04-06 and formulate a plan for palliative
radiation. He was discharged on dexamethasone 2mg BID with
tapering plan to be determined by Craig Ramos.

# Metastatic RCC: Patient not responding to nivolumab. He has
progressive disease
with metastasis in brain, spine, lung (causing hemoptysis) and
supraclavicular soft tissue.
- Palliative RT being discussed as above
- Will start axitinib as outpatient per primary oncologist as
long as no further hemoptysis.

# Cancer-associated VTE: Patient had been on lovenox 2015 mg bid
for 5 weeks but this was held on admission due to hemoptysis and
new brain metastases. IVC filter unlikely to be helpful in this
regard.
- Outpatient providers Urology continue to reassess risk/benefit of
anticoagulation and whether to resume.

# Pain
- Fentanyl patch, morphine 1993

CHRONIC ISSUES:
=======================
# Anemia
Currently stable.  Likely secondary to chronic illness and
hemoptysis
- trending

# Volume overload/RV failure: Echo on 2025-02-26 showed elevated RV
pressure, elevated RV pressures, and hyperdymamic LV.
- continue lasix 40 mg qd

# Hypercalcemia: Likely secondary to malignancy. Remains stable.

- Monitor labs need bisphosphonate, likely as outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================
Radiation Oncology to set patient up for palliative RT to lung
lesion to reduce risk of recurrent hemoptysis.
Dr Tonya Smith to review MRI at neuro-tumor board and discuss
radiation plan for brain and if to repeat MRI with contrast.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr Skinner,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. You were admitted to the hospital
because you were coughing up blood. This improved when your
blood thinner was stopped. The underlying cause is the cancer in
your lungs. For now we will keep your blood thinner on hold.

You were also evaluated for the cancer in your brain and spine.
You were given steroids to help with the swelling around the
tumor. We are working on arrangements for radiation for this.

Followup Instructions:
A monthly check-up is recommended to assess ongoing stability.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Mejia is an 2006 with hx thoracic/abdominal aortic
aneurysm, afib (CHADSVASC 8, not on AC), CVA with residual
L-sided weakness, seizure disorder, dementia, HFpEF, COPD, HTN,
who presents as a transfer from Duke University Hospital for abdominal pain and
concern for ischemic bowel.

The patient was recently admitted 2025-03-16 for abdominal
pain
and N/V. At that time CTA torso showed fusiform aneurysm of the
aortic arch measuring 4.2cm in diameter, fusiform aneurysm with
mural thrombus in the descending thoracic aorta measuring 6.4 x
4.9 cm, and fusiform 5.9 x 6 cm aneurysm with mural thrombus
involving the infrarenal abdominal aorta, all of which appeared
stable since 2025-05-02. She was evaluated by Vascular Surgery who
deemed her a poor surgical candidate and recommended medical
management which was pursued with uptitration of beta blocker
for
goal SBP<120 and HR 50-60s. She was discharged on metoprolol XL
75mg daily + digoxin 0.125mg daily. She was also treated for an
uncomplicated UTI with 3 days of Bactrim. The patient was also
noted to have diarrhea which resolved during admission. Of note,
goals of care discussions were initiated but not able to be
completely elucidated due to patient confusion.

On interview, the patient and her son report that since getting
home from the hospital she has felt overall unwell. She has had
generalized weakness, subjective fevers, and ongoing abdominal
pain. The patient reports that the abdominal pain became worse
yesterday, followed by several episodes of clear-colored emesis.
The patient has also apparently not eaten anything for several
days due to N/V and loss of appetite. She also reports diarrhea
but last BM was yesterday or the day before.

The patient initially presented to Sarah Peterson on 2025-01-29 ngio chest/abdomen showed known thoracic and abdominal aortic
aneurysm as well as wall thickening in sigmoid colon and dilated
small bowel loops. The patient was subsequently transferred to
Seoul National University Hospital for further management and Vascular/General Surgery
evaluation.

In the ED,
- Initial Vitals:

- Imaging:
Stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette compared

may relate to thoracic aortic aneurysm in this patient with
history of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.
Increased interstitial markings bilaterally may relate to
interstitial lung disease and/or interstitial edema. Basilar
consolidation due to pneumonia and/or aspiration is difficult to
exclude.

- Consults:
Vascular Surgery
Per review of the chart the patient has a DO NOT REPAIR note for
her aneurysm, dated 2025-01-20. Review of the imaging reveals that
the
aneurysm is stable in size and her CT scan from 2025-02-13 is only
notable for moderate wall thickening of the sigmoid colon along
with multiple loops of small bowel with air fluid levels. On my
exam she is nontender with no rigidity or guarding. The etiology
of her hypotension and mild lactic acidosis may reflect
hypovolemia. Sepsis cannot be excluded and would recommend blood
cultures, urine analysis, chest x-ray along with fluid
rescucitation. Continue to trend lactic acid and perform
abdominal exams. Her continued abdominal pain appears chronic
and
may reflect underlying progressive mesenteric ischemia (as her
vessels are occluded on imaging). However based on the goals of
care discussion, dated 2025-07-27 it is clear that we would not
intervene on this aneurysm. Recommend continued goals of care
discussion with the family focusing on alleviating pain and
minimizing discomfort. Vascular is available to answer any
questions or concerns. In summary:
Differential of hypotension broad: hypovolemia, sepsis,
possible progressive mesenteric ischemia, diverticulitis.
Recommend work up per ED, trending lactic acid, fluid
rescucitation and if indicated antibiotic coverage with cultures
Refer to DO NOT REPAIR note, dated 2025-01-20 in terms of her
thoracoabdominal aneurysm
Contact family regarding ongoing goals of care discussion with
focus on alleviating pain and the need for repeat ER visits

CT angio chest/abdomen from 2025-07-21:
- Descending thoracic aorta dilated up to 5.3cm including mural
thrombus. Linear hyperdensity within the mural thrombus may
indicate intramural hematoma
- Aortic arch dilated up to 4.3cm
- Cardiomegaly
- Enlarged, nodular thyroid
- Prominent main PA
- infrarenal abdominal aorta dilated up to 5.7cm including mural
thrombus. Linear hyperdensity within mural thrombus suggests
intramural hematoma
- suprarenal abdominal aorta dilated up to 4.1cm
- mild walk thickening of sigmoid colon may represent muscular
hypertrophy or early diverticulitis. No evidence of free air or
diverticular abscess.
- multiple prominent small bowel loops may represent ileus or
enteritis

TTE 2025-04-06
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no
evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is
>15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with a normal cavity size. There is
suboptimal image quality to assess regional left ventricular
function. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic. Quantitative biplane left ventricular
ejection fraction is 76 % (normal
54-73%). Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5
L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular
outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen.
Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with
normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus is mildly dilated with
a normal ascending aorta diameter for
gender. The aortic arch is mildly dilated with a mildly dilated
descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve
prolapse. There is an eccentric, inferolateral
directed jet of mild Reflex mildly present mitral regurgitation. Due to the
Coanda effect, the severity of mitral
regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild Reflex mildly present
tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Preserved global biventricular
systolic function (suboptimal image quality to assess for
regional dysfunction). Mildly dilated aortic root. Mild mitral
and tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Mejia is an 2006 with hx thoracic/abdominal aortic
aneurysm, afib (CHADSVASC 8, not on AC), CVA with residual
L-sided weakness, seizure disorder, dementia, HFpEF, COPD, HTN,
who presented as a transfer from Duke University Hospital for abdominal pain and
concern for colitis. She was initially admitted to the ICU with
hypotension with BP 80/50s. She received a total of 5L of IVF
resuscitation, which raised her BPs to 100/60s (per last
hospitalization, baseline SBP 90-110s). She was treated with
Cipro/Flagyl for colitis. She was briefly on PO vanc while C.
diff was sent, but this returned negative and vancomycin was
discontinued. She was transferred to the floor on 2025-02-05 where she
was continued on cipro/flagyl with plan for 10-day course of
antibiotics (Day 31).

=====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
 Needs to follow up with her PCP at appointment on 2025-05-26.
Please check electrolytes and Blood pressure at this
appointment.
 Home gabapentin was held this admission given concern for
altered mental status. Please consider resuming gabapentin as
needed at PCP 2025-05-26.
 Please note that her home digoxin dose was changed from 0.125
to 0.0625.
 She is being treated with flagyl and ciprofloxacin for
colitis. Start date was 2025-05-27, end date is 2025-02-26.

==================
ACUTE ISSUES
================
# Colitis, Abdominal pain:
She presented with acute on chronic abdominal pain and multiple
episodes of emesis. CT abdomen at 2025-01-13 was concerning for
sigmoid colon wall thickening suggestive of possible early
diverticulitis as well as dilated small bowel loops c/w ileus vs
enteritis. Aortic aneurysm was stable but continuing to occlude
celiac, SMA, and Daniel Adams vessels which could lead to progressive
mesenteric ischemia. Vascular surgery consulted in ED,
recommended no intervention regardless. Developed diarrhea,
negative for C diff. Her diarrhea resolved during her stay as
did her abdominal pain. She was treated with ciprofloxacin and
flagyl for total 10 day course (d1 = 2025-05-27, should end 2025-02-26).

# Hypotension and leukocytosis
She presented initially with hypotension to BP 85/55 improved
with
IVF alone. She also had an lactate that resovled with fluids in
the ICU and she was transferred to the floor. On the floor she
remained normotensive with SBPs in the 120s and her leukocytosis
improved while on flagyl/cipro. Thus, her hypotension and
leukocytosis were likely explained by the colitis.

# Chronic HFpEF
She has a history of heart failure of preserved ejection
fraction with LVEF>55% on 2025-03-10. She received a total of 5L of
fluids for resuscitation with stabilization of hemodynamic
status. She denied any SOB after IVF resuscitation and remained
euvlemic to slightly wet. A TTE on 2025-04-06 revealed an EF of 76%
with biatrial enlargement and preserved global biventricular
systolic function. On 2025-05-14 her diuretics were resumed when her
blood pressures had been stable for days.

# Coagulopathy
INR 1.4 on admission, not on AC normal PTT, plts, and Hb.
Thought to be secondary to her known nutritional deficiency.
Notably also has
history of multiple brain bleeds. INR on discharge was 1.5.

# Deconditioning
Occupational therapy was consulted, recommended discharge to home following 10 Inpatient visits. Nutrition was consulted, recommended ensure enlive TID,
MVI
with minerals, which were started.

# Goals of Care
At last hospitalization, goals of care discussions were
initiated
but no final decision made and patient was kept full code.

CHRONIC ISSUES
=======================
# Thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm
She was maintained on her home metoprolol at fractionated dose.

# Atrial fibrillation
Digoxin was decreased to 0.0625 given her soft blood pressures
and her metoprolol was fractionated as an inpatient.

# COPD
- continued albuterol prn

# Seizure disorder
- continued home keppra 1500mg daily

# GERD
- continued home pantoprazole 40mg QD

# ?Chronic pain
- held home gabapentin given concern for altered mental status

# Hyperthyroidism
- home methimazole was initially held given dose was not clear.
When dose was cleared with pharmacy, it was resumed on 2025-06-28.

History of Present Illness:
David Nunez is a 2005 year-old R-handed woman, pmh of
depression, who presents with neck pain.
For the past 2 weeks, she had right-sided neck pain, described
as
""spasm"" or ""neck stiffness"". It was a gradual onset. She tried
icy hot, and tried BenGay without relief. She denied any neck
manipulations, any trauma, or any exercise. Pain continued until
2 days prior to admission. 2 days prior to admission she had an
acute onset of left-sided neck pain which she states was much
more intense, and also supplied headaches causing pain from the
neck into the top of the head. She describes headaches as
pressure-like sensations without nausea/ vomiting/ photophobia/
or phonophobia occurring every Daily minutes.

She was unable to sleep overnight, so she presented to an outside
hospital for evaluation. At the outside hospital, went and

MRI Head and Neck
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect,
midline shift or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in caliber and
configuration. There are no chronic small vessel ischemic
changes. The
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells are patent. Visualized
orbits are
normal. Intracranial flow voids are preserved.

MRA brain: The intracranial vertebral and internal carotid
arteries and their major branches appear normal without evidence
of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation. Bilateral
intracranial vertebral arteries are patent, and left vertebral
artery is mildly dominant, appearance is unchanged since prior.
Bilateral PCOM, A-comm are patent. The right A1 segment is
hypoplastic.
There is no evidence of intramural hematoma within vessels of
the visualized upper neck, head.
2D time-of-flight images of the neck demonstrate mildly
diminished flow in the V 2 segment of the left vertebral artery
in the mid neck, and moderately diminished flow within V2
segment of right vertebral artery in the low neck, similar
compared to prior.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#Acute renal failure on CKD
Pt presented with Cr of 4.4 up from baseline of 2.6. Had no
issues with volume overload, electrolytes, acidosis, or anemia.
Received extensive renal and inflammatory work-up that was
unremarkable (Urine Sediment Normal + w/ titer at 1:1280
from 1:2560 baseline, negative dsDNA, normal complement levels).
Was started on gentle IV fluids, and SCr continued to recover,
w/ discharge SCr of 2.9. Remained hemodynamically stable with no
need for HD over the course of her hospitalization. Renal was
consulted.

#Cognitive Impairment
Patient suspected to have cognitive impairment given
conversations over the course of hospitalization. MOCA was
administered in mid-afternoon while patient sitting up in chair,
dressed well, and well oriented w/ result of 10/30 (severe cognitive decline). Pt family
supports chronic time course of cognitive decline (with
noticeable deficits appearing about 08:34 AM year ago). Most likely,
her cognitive impairment, in conjunction with mild depression
from the loss of her husband, contributed to decreased PO intake
leading to dehydration. Was seen by OT and SW and Cardiology, and
assessed ability to keep up with ADLs and found that she has
ability to do so, but will need 24hr attention from family
members. Given she had good support at home from family members,
she was safe and stable for a discharge home.

#RLE Cellulitis
Patient began complaining of pain in her foot after walking with
Wheelchair. Was found to have swollen foot and received work-up (RLE U/S
w/ no signs of DVT, Foot XR significant for soft tissue swelling
- no fracture). The plantar surface of the foot was found to
have three deep lacerations of unknown chronicity (on heel, East Lori
& East Lori toe) w/ associated tenderness. No sign of purulence or
abscess. Began treatment with Cephalexin 500mg TID for treatment
of bacterial cellulitis for one week duration (Day 1: 2025-03-09 - Day
7: 2025-02-26. Pt encouraged to ice and elevate RLE as well, and
follow-up with Podiatry as outpatient re: chronic foot care.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# History of connective tissue disease (limited scleroderma vs.
overlap syndrome- stable since 2025-06-24 seen yearly by rheum).
Positive HBsAg 1:2560 with anti centromere pattern, positive
RNP, dsDNA, and Ro. During this admission, Positive HBsAg positive (titer
1:1280- anticentromere ab positive), but dsDNA negative, SPEP
unremarkable. Seen by Rheumatology, who felt there was no
evidence of a connective tissue disease flare, and recommended
no acute treatment.

#Pruritis: stable over course of admission. Treated w.
Betamethasone 0.1% lotion.

#Anxiety: continued deipramine with inpatient w/ lorazepam as
needed.

#CAD
#HTN
#Peripheral artery disease (right aortoiliac mod-sev)
#Carotid artery disease
#History of ventricular ectopy:
Continued on Rosuvastatin, metoprolol, and amlodipine while
inpatient.

#Stage IA Adenocarcinoma of the Lung s/p 16 Cyberknife
treatments (ended 2025-07-06: Follow-up scheduled on 2025-01-09,

History of Present Illness:
1976 female history of hypertension, diastolic CHF,
atrial fibrillation, post-op NSTEMI who is transferred from
assisted living facility for generalized weakness. Her daughter
provides the history.

Earlier this 2020, in late February, she presented after a
fall at her assisted living, and was found to have a UTI;
discharge with week of Keflex. She became weak during this
infection and in the last month she has not yet regained her
strength and she continued to have urinary frequency; her
daughter feels that this is indicative of incompletely treated
UTI, although the patient was not having ongoing fevers,
dysuria, or hematuria.

She was again hospitalized at Mayo Medical Center East Crystal - H123 after a
fall in the bathroom at Rheumatology Specialty Clinic living. She was found to have
another UTI (pan-sensitive E coli), as well as nondisplaced
left fibular fracture (non-op). She was treated with IV
ceftriaxone and transitioned to PO cefpodoxime. She was
discharged to her nursing facility where she developed large
volume foul-smelling diarrhea for the last 2 days, as well as
worsening generalized weakness. Her daughter reports fever to
101 at home, with decreased appetite, poor PO intake, decreased
UOP, and lower abdominal pain.

Of note, while in West Thomas she was also noted to be hypoxic to
90% on room air, a d-dimer was elevated, CT angiogram showed no
pulmonary embolism, ?non-obs R UPJ stone.

Due to her diarrhea, she was Wheelchair to the ED.

IMAGING:
======

KUB 2025-07-22
There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. Evidence of hiatal
hernia containing bowel and stomach partially imaged. Blunting
of the left costophrenic angle is again noted. There is lumbar
levoscoliosis and multi-level degenerative changes along the
spine. Partially imaged is a right hip prosthesis. IMPRESSION:
No evidence of bowel obstruction. No dilated loops of bowel
to suggest megacolon.

CXR PA/LAT 2025-02-03
Evidence of a large diaphragmatic, hiatal hernia is again seen
with intrathoracic stomach and loops of bowel. There is slight
blunting of the left costophrenic angle and there may be trace
pleural effusion. Retrocardiac opacity likely relates to large
hiatal hernia with associated atelectasis. Underlying
consolidation is not excluded although felt less likely.

CXR PA/LAT 2025-02-03:
There is a prominent air-filled have a circular opacity
corresponding to a
hiatal hernia best seen on CT dated 2025-02-06. There is
relatively low
lung volumes with basilar atelectasis. No other parenchymal
consolidation is
seen. No pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion is seen.
IMPRESSION:
Low lung volumes with basilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
1976 F with hx of atrial fibrillation (no longer on
anticoagulation 2025-06-18 vaginal and GI bleeding), diastolic CHF with
EF of 50-55%, prior NSTEMI, history of cervical cancer status
post radiation, recurrent UTI s/p multiple courses abx tx, right
hip repair in 1990 presenting with diarrhea from assisted living
facility, found to be positive for C.difficile.

ACUTE ISSUES:
==========
# Clostridium Difficile colitis:
Recent hospitalization and antibiotic exposure (especially oral
cephalosporin) w/ elevated white count in conjunction w/
diarrhea, concerning for C diff infection. Outside records
obtained and patient found to be C. DIF POSITIVE. Prior to
admission, patient took Immodium x 2, and since that time had no
further diarrhea until 2025-02-10 AM. In the interim, no
indication of acute abdomen or any sign of toxic megacolon.
Flagyl contraindicated due to QTc prolongation with amiodarone,
and she is likely to fail treatment on flagyl due to healthcare
exposures and specific resistance patterns of C.diff since she
lives in assisted living.
-Placed on oral vancomycin 125mg PO QID (started 2025-03-02 for
total of 1:2ischarged on this regimen.
-Held Pantoprazole as per pharmacy (in context of C. dif), and
asked to restart 48 hours after completing abx
-At time of discharge tolerating PO fluids/food, though appetite
very poor and needs assistance for feedings. Speech/swallow WNL.
# Hiatal Hernia/Hypoxia:
Patient has oxygen saturation in low 2005, and xrays show lung
volume restriction. This is likely Sliding hiatal hernia with
kyphosis contributing to restrictive lung disease. No evidence
pneumonia on repeat CXR. Important to maintain upright
positioning and assist patient with meals. In addition, acid
suppression as necessary as an outpatient.

# UTI:
Urine culture from 2025-06-19 showed pan-sensitive E.coli, which
has grown in the last 3 urine cultures from 2025-03-05. She
received a full 7 day course of antibiotics - cefpodoxime
transitioned to IV ceftriaxone 1g q24h. This course was started
on 2025-02-21 and discontinued on 2025-06-18. No dysuria,
hematuria, hesitancy, frequency during hospitalization.

# L wrist pain. On 2025-06-11 pt had acute onset L wrist pain w/
mild erythema and swelling, ortho attempted tap w/o success,
XRay w/ chondrocalcinosis; picture c/w pseudogout. No
intervention as NSAIDs contraindicated in this pt with CHF and
did not want to give steroids. Pt placed in splint to rest
joint, improved overnight, swelling and erythema resolved by
time of discharge.

# CHF:
History of dCHF, and remained hypo- to euvolemic and
asymptomatic during hospitalization. Continued spironolactone,
assessed fluid status daily. Was discharged euvolemic with no
indication of volume overload.

# A-fib: Not on anticoagulation secondary to recurrent bleeding.
Flipped between afib with RVR and NSR Permanent. Spoke to outpatient
cardiologist (Dr. John Wood who recommended increasing dose of
amiodarone x 4 days. Gave 200mg extra dose 2025-01-02 and converted
into sustained NSR.
- continue increased dose of 400mg amio x 3 days
- At discharge continued normal amiodarone dose of 200mg daily.

Chronic Issues:
==========
#Hypertension - Stable during hospitalization with outpatient
meds continued.
#Macular degeneration - Stable. Further management as
outpatient.
#Hard of hearing - Stable. Further management as outpatient.

# Transitional Issues:
- Important to follow up with PCP 2025-01-05 2 weeks of discharge
- Patient needs assistance with meals due to weakness/
deconditioning, and PO intake should be encouraged
- Vancomycin started 2025-03-02 late 11:53 PM - with goal for full 14
day course. Will provide prescription for remainder of course as
outpatient
- Consider further investigation of minimally invasive repairs
or palliation for severe hiatal hernia
- re-address goals of care

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. Martinez,

You were admitted to Mayo Medical Center due to
severe diarrhea and weakness. During your admission it was found
that you have an infection called Clostridium Difficile (C.
Diff) which is a bacterium common in patients who have recently
been prescribed antibiotics. You were treated with a medication
called Vancomycin which improved your diarrhea. You were able to
eat and drink and pass regular bowel movements, and so you were
discharged to a rehab facility. After discharge it is important
to continue your Vancomycin course to ensure that your infection
fully resolves. While in the hospital you also completed your
full course of antibiotics for your urinary tract infection.

It has been a pleasure caring for you here at Mayo Medical Center and we wish
you all the best!

Kind regards,
Your Endocrinology Clinic Team

FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary): NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.

CXR: IMPRESSION: Widespread opacification of the right
mid-to-lower hemithorax with mass effect, suspected to represent
a pleural effusion at least in part, including a possible large
loculated component; a mass could also be considered, in
addition to widespread atelectasis or pneumonic consolidation.

CTAP:IMPRESSION: 2025-03-09. Large loculated right pleural
effusion; saccular bronchiectasis of the bilateral lower lobes
and consolidation of the right middle and right lower lobes with
heterogeneous hypoenhancement and rounded hypodensities that may
represent either the underlying saccular bronchiectasis versus
multifocal necrotizing pneumonia. 2. Cholelithiasis without
cholecystitis. 3. Hilar lymphadenopathy may be reactive; follow
up imaging after treatment is recommended to ensure resolution.

CXR: 2025-01-14 Right lower lobe opacity a combination of
consolidation and pleural effusion has increased. Left lower
lobe retrocardiac consolidation has worsened consistent with
worsening atelectasis and/or pneumonic consolidation. There is
no evident pneumothorax. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is
obscured by the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Callahan with HIV on HARRT (CD4 count of 800), HCV (failed
treatment), history of IVDU on methadone, who presented with
dyspnea and was found to have pneumonia and empyema. He was
treated with antibiotics and had a chest tube placed. The
cultures from the sputum and pleural fluid returned and he was
switched to IV cefepime and PO flagyl for a 4 week course. ID
will follow as an outpatient.

# Pneumonia with empyema: He had hypoxemia, pneumonia and a
large empyema on chest CT. He was initially started on
vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Interventional
pulmonology placed a chest tube on 2025-08-14. The effusion was
loculated and required tPA and Albumin injections. The results of
the pleural effusion cultures were strep milleri species. Sputum
cultures grew Beta streptococcus group C, enterobacter
aerogenes, acinetobacter baumannii complex, haemophilus
influenza and beta lactamase negative (see results secontion).
He improved with treatment and drainage and his chest tube was
pulled on 2025-04-09. He was seen by infectious disease specialists
who recommended a 4 week course of cefepime and flagyl. He will
need to continue this until 2025-04-05 (and will need to be seen
by ID prior to discontinuation). A picc line was placed. He
should not be discharged from rehab with the Inserted as he is at
risk of IVDU. After completion of his antibiotics this should be
removed. At the time of discharge he was on 1L NC.

# Opioid dependence: He takes 91mg of methadone per day (Habit
OPAC on 2025-01-31). He was continued on methadone 90mg per day.
He is at risk of abuse of the PICC. This should be removed prior
to discharge. He is also getting oxycodone as needed for pain.

# Chronic CO2 retention: Likely secondary to COPD or obesity
hypoventilation syndrome. He has been relatively stable with NC
and has not required positive pressure ventilation. This should
be evaluated further after discharge. He was treated with PRN
nebulizers.

# Hyponatremia: He had hyponatremia. Initially he was treated
with IVF with some improvement in his sodium. However, the urine
lytes were suggestive of SIADH. Thus, he was put on a fluid
restriction. However, the patient was unhappy with this and
refused to comply. His Na was stable at 132 without treatment.
Sodium should be checked a couple of times per week to make sure
it is stable at rehab.

# HIV: His most recent CD4 count is 875 with a viral load of
2422. He should be continued on truvada and kaletra.

# Hypertension: He was continue on amlodipine BID. Blood
pressures largely controlled.

# Anxiety: He was continued on his clonazepam.

# Constipation: he was writted for a bowel regimen

# Asthma: stable, continued on inhalers.

IMAGING:
=======================
CXR (2025-07-12):
Mild hilar engorgement without frank pulmonary edema.

MRI (2025-07-12):
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower
extremity veins.

ECG (2025-07-12):
Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Consider prior
inferior wall
myocardial infarction. Left anterior fascicular block. Delayed R
wave
transition. Compared to the previous tracing of 2025-07-12 no
diagnostic interim change.

TTE (2025-07-12):
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-07-12,
the findings are similar.

MICROBIOLOGY:
=======================
2025-07-12 7:00 pm BLOOD CULTURE: No growth to date

Brief Hospital Course:
1971 year old male with hx of NICM (EF 35%), s/p AICD (Single-chamber), HTN,
IDDM, HCV c/b cirrhosis, Variceal bleed presenting with Fever and
hypoxia in setting of decompensated systolic heart failure.

# Acute on chronic sCHF: EF 35% at baseline (NICCM) s/p ICD
placement. Echo findings include LVH, hypokinesis, normal
aortic valve and slight mitral valve regurgitation, with LVEF =
35%. Dry weight from 2025-07-28 237 lbs. Weight peak 257 lbs this
month. During hospitalization placed on lasix gtt with one dose
metolazone. Diuresed well, transitioned to IV lasix boluses and
later to PO torsemide. On day of discharge on 60 mg PO torsemide
BID (home regimen) with 1.5L fluid restriction. Weight at
discharge stable at 243.8 lbs.
-Metolazone was not restarted.
-lisinopril and spironolactone were stopped in setting of Completed course
lisinopril will need to be added slowly at Skilled Nursing Facility. Spironolactone
can be titrated at next cardiology appointment

# Hypoxia: Patient presented with hypoxia with new O2
requirement. Elevated D-dimer and was treated empirically for PE
with heparin gtt, but given low Wells score, gtt was
discontinued. Had evidence of volume overload on initial exam
with inspiratory crackles that improved with diuresis. Of note,
patient has had a history of left greater than right lower
extremity swelling during acute sCHF exacerbations. With
diuresis patient weaned off of supplemental O2. Satting well at
room air on discharge.

#Acute on chronic kidney disease: baseline Cr 1.3. On
presentation Cr 2.9, considered to be prerenal from decreased
forward flow/cardiorenal. With initial diuresis Cr downtrended
to trough of 1.5. Uptrended and plateaued at 1.9 after lasix
gtt, IV lasix boluses, and transition to PO torsemide.

# HTN: On admission was discontinued from lisinopril and
spironolactone for concern of Elevated creatinine. SBPs peaked to 120-150s.
Increased imdur from 60 to 90 mg and hydralazine from 50 to 75
mg q6h. Blood pressure control achieved, with SBPs ranging from
110-120s. Continued on home carvedilol.

# CAD: per OMR note, was cath'd at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital 2025-07-13 showing 70% Right
PDA lesion, without apparent intervention. Has trop and CKMB
elevation on admission that downtrended near recent baselines
without evidence of new ischemic EKG changes. Was maintained on
carvedilol and aspirin.

# Chronic pain: Patient on narcotics at facility for diabetic
neuropathy. On prior admissions, was noted to be very lethargic
on home pain regimen in setting of Sepsis. Pregabalin renally
dosed to 75 mg PO BID. MS SR 15 mg reduced to half dose (15 mg PO
q12) given Liver impairment. Oxycodone was initially decreased, however was
resumed on home dosage upon discharge with improvement of renal
function.

# HCV: Showed no signs of synthetic dysfunction or active
disease on labs. LFTs stable. Mild asterixis on exam, though
thought to be secondary to uremia to Hypertension and uremia from COVID-19 Pneumonia.

# IDDM: Blood sugars well controlled, ranging from 100-220s.
Continued glargine, humalog and HISS Short-acting insulin

# Bipolar: continued depakote, sertraline

On discharge, he was non orthostatic, tolerating his BP
medication regimen, and was feeling well with stable renal
function.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Joe Stephenson is a 2022 male transferred to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital ED via
med-flight from Duke University Hospital on 2025-04-27 after he was found
non-responsive in bed, and had witnessed seizures. He arrived to
the outside hospital at 2:20 04:22 PM and was post-ichtal upon
arrival. He then had a second seizure witnessed at the outside
hospital and was subsequently intubated for airway protection.
At the outside hospital they found a large SDH with midline
shift and evidence of herniation. He was transferred to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital
after intubation.

He is on Coumadin for CAD, atrial fibrillation (s/p valve
replacement). He received 10 units of vitamin K, two units of
FFP, and 1500mg of Dilantin at the outside hospital prior to
arrival to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.

Per arrival report, Medflight reports that 3% hypertonic saline
was running at 3cc/kg at the OSH, and that he received 250 of
fentanyl. En route, he was on a propofol drip for transfer, and
was reportedly a GCS of five prior to arrival.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Joe Stephenson was admitted to the Neurosurgery Service at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital
on 2025-08-02 for further management of a left-sided SDH with
extensive midline shift, uncal herniation, and obstructive
hydrocephalus. He was maintained on Keppra for seizure
prophylaxis. Given the imaging findings and patient's poor
neurologic exam, surgical decompression was not recommended. The
patient's health care proxy was in agreement that return to
baseline not anticipated, the patient would not want surgery
performed. The patient was admitted to the ICU for further
management. After repeat family discussion, the decision was
made to move forward with comfort care. The patient was
terminally extubated in the early morning of 2025-02-08.

On 2025-02-08, continuing with comfort care. Discussed with family at

hyponatremia, pneumonia, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Allison Guerrero 2025-07-18

History of Present Illness:
Robert Simon with hx of htn, subclinical hypothyroidism, failure to
thrive presenting for asymptomatic hyponatremia. Pt was
hospitalized 2025-02-16 for failure to thrive, DOE and weight
loss. During that hospitalization, pt was noted to have 3 kg in 1 month lb
weight loss. Extensive evaluation, including CTA chest, CT
abd/pelvis with contrast, was unrevealing; Pt was noted to have
limited mobility and marked deconditioning, with severe
malnutrition. ADditional testing, including PSA, HIV, RPR were
were all negative/WNL. He was discharged at that time to rehab
for weight gain and Independent ambulation. His DOE was thought to be related to
severe deconditioning, with normal BNP, negative CT-PE. He was
found to have vitamin D level of 10, and was started on
replacement, in addition to MVI, thiamine, folate. UA revealed
microscopic hematuria, for which he was referred to urology. At
this f/u urology apt at 2025-04-25, he was found to have Na 121, and
was directed to the ED for further treatment. Of note, he was
started on Prozac 10 mg daily on 2025-01-19.

Pt reports, and records confirm, that he has never been
hyponatremic before. He endorses dizziness with standing for the
past 2025 years. He believes that his orthostasis has worsened over
the past 9 days. On several occasions he has felt like he
would fall, but has been able to catch himself on every
occasion. He describes difficulty walking, which he notes was
the reason for his admission in 1973. He notes DOE, but also
global weakness, most pronounced in his legs. He describes
decreased PO intake over the past 2 weeks. He recalls eating
well during his last hospitalization, then while at rehab at
Oncology Department. At home, meals on wheels delivers one meal per
day, 5 times per week, at dinner. This is the only meal that he
eats, aside from an occasional banana or yogurt. He describes
anorexia. He eats a portion of the delivered meal. On the days
that Meals on Wheels does not deliver, he eats at his nephew's
East Travisville. He endorses some depression related to his ""current
condition,"" but denies thoughts of self-harm, SI. He does not
weigh himself at home, although he intends to start doing that.

Since leaving Orthopedic Surgery Department (rehab), he has had either his
sister or his brother staying with him 08:00 PM day every day, and
notes that this has helped his mood, although his appetite
remains poor. He leaves the Lake Susan, ambulates with his walker,
together with his sister or brother.

Denies headaches. Endorses dysphagia with solid foods, not with
liquids, describes paroxysms of cough when eating. He does not
believe that he has had an EGD. Endorses chest pain, described
as chest pressure, L sided, nonradiating, resolves with massage,
lasts minutes, without associated dyspnea, diaphoresis, or
nausea, occurs at rest.

With respect to his dyspnea, a short block of ambulation causes
dyspnea. He denies abdominal pain, diarrhea. Prior constipation
has improved with bowel regimen, although he still sometimes
goes nearly a week between BMs. He has not examined his BMs for
blood. Denies dysuria, gross hematuria. Denies Cardiac edema edema,
numbness, tingling.

DIAGNOSTICS:
==================================================
EKG:
NSR at 62 bpm, normal axis, QTc 454, TWI in aVL, V1-V2, no ST
segment changes, no significant change compared to prior

ECHO 2025-07-17:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild-moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a very
prominent left pleural effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-07-30,
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased and the
left pleural effusion is now larger.

ECHO 2025-07-17:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is a prominent left pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-07-30,
left ventricular function is similar and the estimated PA
systolic pressure is now slightly lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
Robert Simon with history of hypertension, chronic malnutrition, newly
diagnosed hypothyroidism who was initially admitted to Obstetrics and Gynecology service on 2025-06-21 for asymptomatic hyponatremia
incidentally found on routine labs at his urologist's office,
and was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory
failure on 2025-06-12 secondary to pneumonia. Patient was unable to be
weaned off ventilator, required tracheostomy and Foley catheter tube
placement. Hospital course complicated by HIT, type II NSTEMI,
adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient transferred to ICU
for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to weakness as a
result of severe malnutrition/deconditioning. Pt received a Appendectomy on 2025-01-16. Patient was treated with an 8 day course of
antibiotics for Serratia and Klebsiella PNA. Patient
increasingly tolerating trach mask trials as his strength
regained. Pt steadily worked with Physical during admission. Pt was
stable to discharge to rehab on PSV PSV 20 cmH2O 40% O2.

# Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia: Patient was diagnosed with
HIT during ICU admission and was initiated on argatroban
treatment. His platelets slowly increased to normal and he was
transitioned to warfarin on 2025-08-08 with overlap of argatroban
initially per protocol. Discharged on warfarin 2mg PO daily to
be titrated for goal INR 2.5 â 3.5 (Mechanical prosthetic heart valve). D/C INR 2.8. Patient received 3 mg
warfarin on day of discharge.

#NSTEMI II: During ICU admission, patient complained of L sided
chest pain intermittently. Per sister, pt has been experiencing
chest pain intermittently since 2025-04-30 and was undergoing some
type of cardiac work up (unknown details) prior to admission.
Cardiology was consulted soon after ST seg elevation was noted
on tele while pt was on trach mask trial. ST segment elevation
resolved shortly after pt was placed back on the vent on repeat
EKG. Troponemia during admission was felt to be type II in
nature in the setting of HTN crisis shortly after s/p Allison Guerrero
procedure, increased demand in setting of possible refeeding
syndrome. Patient was started on medical management of presumed
CAD (statin, asa, bb) and was already on argatroban tx for HIT
during majority of ICU admission. Cardiology was consulted and
were not concerned for unstable angina or ischemic event. They
do recommended pMIBI as outpatient.

# Hypothyroidism: Patient presented with TSH 27, FT4 0.6 and was
initiated on levothyroxine. TFT evaluation one week post
initiation of treatment showed TSH and FT4 normalizing. The
patient needs repeat TFTs 6 weeks after initiation of
levothyroxine (2025-07-01).

# Hyponatremia: Deteriorating, and serum osm and physical exam
consistent with hypotonic euvolemic hyponatremia Hypertension
hypothyrodism (which was treated and corrected this admission)
and glucocorticoid deficiency (with a negative cosyntropin
stimulation test). Renal initiated salt tabs early in admission
and they were continued during his ICU stay. After diagnosis of
adrenal insufficiency was made, endocrine initiated
hydrocortisone therapy. Hyponatremia resolved at time of
discharge.

#Adrenal Insufficiency: Confirmed by cosyntropin stimulation
test. CT findings concerning for b/l adrenal hemorrhage vs.
hyperplasia with hemorrhage etiology presumed caused by HIT
versus severe stress. Hydrocortisone was initiated. ACTH was
not elevated, indicating non-primary AI. Endocrine recommends
imaging work-up as outpatient of adrenals and pituitary and
patient will need outpatient endocrinology follow up.

# HTN: Prior h/o hypertension, but patient remained normotensive
until initiation of hydrocortisone for tx of newly discovered
AI. Pt was then started on amlodipine with good effect which
can be uptitrated as needed for adequate blood pressure control.

# Nutritional Status: Patient was initiated on tube feeds, in
the setting of severe malnutrition and concern for refeeding
syndrome, his electrolytes were monitored closely and repleted
as needed. Patient gained weight steadily during his ICU
admission on tube feeding via dobhoff. Patient received a PEG tube
on 2025-05-04 and continued to received nutrition via tube feeds.

# Failure to thrive: The patient was hospitalized from
2025-07-15 with a negative work up for an organic etiology.
Patient has been restricting his calories for years now with the
belief that calorie restriction will make him live longer. Upon
ICU admission, feeds were restarted and his weight steadily
improved. Psych was involved. Patient understands the
importance of nutrition for recovery/rehabilitation and agreed
to a PEG tube which was placed on 2025-05-04.
During admission, he denied any distress surrounding the presence of the PEG tube tube. He was
fully engaged with the medical treatment since admission.

# Chronic Anemia: Patient's hemoglobin ranged between 12-16 g/dL. Iron
studies suggested anemia of chronic disease. Pt was tranfused 1
unit during ICU admission. No active bleeding during admission.

#Diarrhea: Patient has had loose stools since starting TFs.
Cdiff negative. Maximized banana flakes. Started loperamide.
Nutrition recommended if stool output continues to be 1 L per
day, then TPN should be considered.

#Psychiatric Issues: Patient had engaged in severe calorie
restriction and had element of isolation. Psych consulted during
hospitalization and felt this to be a personality trait. They
recommended optimization of nutrition status and then
re-evaluation of psychological issues.

#Transitional Issues
- will need psychiatric follow-up as an outpatient once
nutritional status is optimized
- repeat TFTs 6 wks post initiation levothyroxine (2025-07-01)
- check TFTS 2025-06-14 (one week post PO levothyroxine to make sure
he's absorbing)
- Endocrine follow-up: please obtain imaging of adrenals and
pituitary in outpatient setting as patient had incidental
finding of potential adrenal hemorrhage vs. hyperplasia on CT
and was treated for adrenal insufficiency
- Cardiac stress test (pMIBI) as an outpatient given type II
NSTEMI
- INR monitoring for warfarin with goal of INR 2.5 â 3.5 (Mechanical prosthetic heart valve) currently
receiving daily dosing, 2mg warfarin.

Discharge Instructions:
Hello Mr. Perkins,

You were in the University College Hospital London because of severe
weakness from not eating enough food. While you were in the
hospital, you developed pneumonia, an infection of the lung. You
were treated with antibiotics and you were put on a breathing
machine to help your lungs get oxygen and ultimately needed a
device to help you breath. You also were found to have adrenal
insufficiency and hypothyroidism during your stay, and you were
treated with medicines for these conditions.

Now that you are leaving the hospital, it is important that you
follow up with an endocrinologist to help treat the adrenal
insufficiency and hypothyroidism. You will also need to go to a
cardiologist for a stress test to check the function of your
heart.
Please continue to take all medicines as prescribed.

It has been a pleasure participating in your care.

Thank You,

Your General Medicine Team

Followup Instructions:
Complete the full course of antibiotics and report any side effects."

CXR 2025-07-22:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
2. Aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta, better assessed
in the
concurrent CT torso.

CT HEAD 2025-06-30: Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!
No hemorrhage or fractures. Moderate small vessel ischemic
changes and atropy.

!!
1. T12 compression fracture
2. 5.1cm ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm. No sign of acute
aortic injury.

ECHO 2025-01-16:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 169/94 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta and arch
are moderately dilated. No dissection flap is suggested (does
not exclude). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of 2025-02-19, the ascending aorta and arch are more dilated and
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
If the clinical suspicion for aortic disseciton is moderate or
high, a thoracic CT/MRI or TEE is suggested to better define the
aorta.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has a moderately dilated
ascending aorta. Based on 2002 ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic
Guidelines, if not previously known or a change, a follow-up
echocardiogram is suggested in 6 months; if previously known and
stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in Follow diabetic diet instructions carefully and monitor blood sugar levels twice daily. year.

Brief Hospital Course:
2008 year-old woman with history of cervicalgia and cervical
spondylosis who presents with severe right lower back pain
relating to a recent fall out of her bed. She does have a T12
compression fracture, but this is not the area of her back that
is painful. Her lower back pain is likely from muscle
strain/spasm. It has disabled her to the point that any
movement at all of her torso gives her severe pain. Admitted for
pain control. Encouraged increased mobility and work with
physical therapy to improve lower back pain. Some progress was
made, but patient still requires a great deal of assistance to
even just get out of bed. Non-narcotic pain medications used to
try to reduce narcotic doses. She unfortunately is suffering
urinary retention and constipation likely secondary to
opiate-drug side effect.

PROBLEM LIST.
# Right lower back pain Likely muscle strain/spasm: Aggressive
pain control with use of acetaminophen around the clock,
lidocaine patch, capsaicin cream, oxycodone as needed. Flexeril
added for muscle spasms. Paramount to her recovery will be
getting her out of bed and mobilized.

# Thoracic aortic aneurysm, pt without chest pain, this is an
incidental finding. Echo showed normal tri-leaflet aortic valve
and moderate dilation of ascending aortic artery. Blood pressure
controlled. Referring patient to outpatient Cardiac Surgery
clinic follow-up with Dr. Victor Benton (+916758067677).
Echocardiogram report recommends follow-up Echo in 6-months to
assess for interval change.

# Osteoporosis/T12 compression fracture, likely chronic,
thoracic spine brace as needed for comfort, continue Boniva.

# HTN: Continue Clonidine, Valsartan, Furosemide, Lisinopril.
Consider increasing Lisinopril if further blood pressure control
needed.

# Urinary retention likely due to uncontrolled bleeding narcotic use. Foley in place for
now. Voiding trial once narcotic doses are reduced.

Other issues:
# GERD: Continue PPI
# Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine
# Depression/Anxiety: Continue Citalopram

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for pain control for severe right lower back
pain after you fell out of your bed one week before admission.
It is from muscle spasm or strain. It is important that you
increase your mobility and that you have regular physical
activity each day to help your muscle spasm or strain to improve
and thus reduce pain.

You have also been using narcotic (opiate) pain medications for
your back pain that has been causing both constipation and
urinary retention as side effects. As you reduce your opiate
pain medication use, your providers may consider removing your
catheter to give you a voiding trial.

Incidentally, you were found to have a thoracic aortic aneurysm
of 5.1 cm. An appointment has been made for you to follow-up
with cardiothoracic surgery for further evaluation and
management.

Brief Hospital Course:
On 2025-06-02, Ms. Ray was admitted for elective coiling and
embolization of two right ICA aneurysms. She was loaded with
Brilinta intraoperatively. Postoperatively, she was extubated
and monitored in PACU. Angioseal was attempted and was
unsuccessful; groin pressure was held and she was kept on
bedrest. She was transferred to Pathology and Laboratory Medicine for close neurologic
monitoring where she remained neurologically stable. Plavix was
discontinued and Brilinta continued. Aspirin dosing was
decreased from 325mg to 81mg daily. Overnight, she complained
of neck and jaw pain consistent with her history of angina; EKG
was normal and cardiac enzymes were flat. Electrolytes were
repleted. On POD#1, she remained neurologically and
hemodynamically stable. She was tolerating a house diet and
ambulating with nursing. She was discharged home in stable
condition.

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
Grade IIIA cutaneous follicular lymphoma
-  2025-04-20 six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy, subsequently
followed with serial PET and CT scans
- 2025-04-20 biopsy of a left axillary node, florid reactive
follicular hyperplasia.
- PET scan back in 2025-02-17, which revealed no significant
interval change in the cervical, mediastinal, axillary, and
abdominal pelvic lymph nodes.  There is a small new FDG avid
mesenteric adenopathy.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Peters,

You were admitted due to worsening leg weakness and fall on your
right elbow. You were found to have continued cord compression
and initiated radiation treatment for relief. Your symptoms also
improved with dexamethasone and increasing your pain regimen.
Your blood sugars have increased while on your high dose of
steriods. You will continue your current dosing of steriods for
1 week and then the outpatient team will taper you off of it. We
will increase your insulin regimen in the meantime to better
control your sugars at home.

You also received a dose of pamidronate to help bring calcium
back into your bones to strengthen them.

It was a pleasure taking care of you. Please call in the
meantime with any questions or concerns.

US liver: IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the pancreas and
distal common bile duct due to overlying bowel gas. Normal
sonographic appearance of the liver.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Extensive airspace opacity within the left
lower lobe has improved moderately since the prior exam. There
is no pleural effusion. The heart size is normal. The contrast
bolus is suboptimal, which may relate to the patient's body
habitus. There is evidence of prior ventral hernia repair with a
mesh. The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal. The
gallbladder is surgically absent. Multiple subcentimeter
periportal lymph nodes are again noted. There is mild stranding
of the peripancreatic fat in the region of the celiac axis,
consistent with the patient's clinical picture of pancreatitis.
The pancreas enhances homogeneously. There is no evidence of
complication. No free fluid or abscess formation. The kidneys
enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically with mild stable
perinephric stranding. The intra-abdominal small and large bowel
loops are normal.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Air is seen within the bladder, likely related
to recent Foley catheterization. The sigmoid colon and rectum
are normal. No free fluid or pelvic lymphadenopathy.

No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. Degenerative changes
are noted at L5-S1.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild uncomplicated pancreatitis.

2. Improving left lower lobe pneumonia.

3. Unchanged subcentimeter periportal lymphadenopathy.

CXR: IMPRESSION:

1. Left-mid and lower lung opacity concerning for pneumonia.
Lateral view may be performed to further evaluate.

CT on admission (Torso)
IMPRESSION:
1. Multilobar left-sided consolidation consistent with
pneumonia. Follow up imaging after treatment and resolution of
symptoms recommended.
2. Several periportal lymph nodes which are not enlarged by CT
criteria, although more numerous than typically are seen.
3. Nonspecific stranding surrounding the kidneys. Please
correlate with urinalysis/culture.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was diagnosed with pneumoni and required O2 and
pressors for hypotension. After clinical stabilization in ICU,
he was transferred to floor. After initial broad spectrum
antibitics, he was tapered to levofloxacin. In terms of the
diarrhea, at discharge the patient reported his diarrhea was at
baseline. He was continued on flagyl at home dose and C diff was
negative. ARF resolved completely with fluids and thought to be
from hypovolemia. Similarly, hyponatremia resolved. Guiac
positive stool are likely from Crohns disease. A recent
colonoscopy was done that revealed colitis. He has a follow up
with Dr Heidi Murray week.

In the hospital, he was noted to have elevated lipase, US and CT
abd negative for gall stone or tumor. GI consulted and did not
recommend further testing, but to follow up with Dr Heidi Murray
further assessment. Interestingly, he had no abdominal pain,
nausea or vomiting and was eating a regular diet at the time of
pancreatitis.

Sugars were mildly high. Given h/o obesity he may have impaired
glucose tolerance. Also noted to be tachycardic on ambulation,
but asymptomatic. Further PCP follow up is recommended.

Chief Complaint:
Chemotherapy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Packed red blood cell transfusion.
Placement and removal of central line.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 2011 year old female with past medical history of
mantle cell lymphoma, who presents for her second cycle of
ESHAP. She reports that she feels overall very well and has no
particular concerns or complaints. She relates that her PICC
line was initially mis-positioned, but later fixed.
.
Review of systems:
She denies any recent fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain,
shortness of breath, headaches, visual changes, cough,
difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, N/V/D/C, rashes, leg or
joint swelling. She has noted stable lymphadenopathy.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
Patient was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma in 2001. She
completed four cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy followed by
Zevalin by 1971. In 2007, she had a PET
scan in 2013, which showed significant interval worsening
in
size and amount of the FDG-avid disease in the neck,
chest, abdomen and pelvis. At that time, she was
noted to have an approximately 1.5 cm left posterior cervical
lymph node and leukocytosis. A biopsied of this was consistent
with mantle cell and she began treatment with Velcade/Rituxan.
She initially did well, with a notable decrease in the size of
her left cervical node and normalization of her white blood
count.
.
Unfortunately, she had growth of in a left cervical node with a
normal white count. At the end of her 63934 cycle of
Velcade/Rituxan, with the addition of dexamethasone, she had had
marked growth of a left cervical node to ~ 4cm and she was
admitted for EPOCH on 2025-04-18. She was admitted for cycle 2 of
EPOCH on 2025-06-02, and cycle 3, with Rituxan on 2025-02-12. These
admissions were uneventful.
.
She had a PET done on 2025-04-12 which demonstrated decrease in the
size
and FDG-avidity of the cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes,
as well as the pre vascular soft tissue mass.
.
She was admitted on 2025-03-07 with the intent for autologous stem
cell transplant, however a CXR done to assess a line placement
at that time discovered a new fullness in the area of the
aortopulmonic window and left hilus--a CT confirmed that she had
interval progression of disease with increase in anterior
mediastinal soft tissue mass with central necrosis, as a new
smaller soft tissue lesion in the superior mediastinum in between the
innominate and left common carotid artery. Due to this, she
received ESHAP with plans to still pursue transplant if disease
remained stable after that treatment. She received Neulasta 2025-06-02.
.
Unfortunately, a repeat PET on 2025-06-10 demonstrated progression
of her disease with increase in FDG-avid large anterior mass and
nodes, as well as her cecum, as compared to 2025-01-16. Per her
primary oncologist, as compared to her CT from 2025-02-28, there was
improvement in the mediastinal area, that had shrunk. Due to
this response, she was admitted for additional ESHAP therapy.
.
Her most recent bone marrow biopsy was done on 2025-05-31 and
showed a mildly hypocellular marrow with trilineage
hematopoiesis without evidence of mantle cell lymphoma.
Cytogenetics were normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a very pleasant 2011 year old female with history of
mantle cell lymphoma, who presents for her second cycle of
ESHAP.
.
# Mantle cell lymphoma: Patient was admitted for her second
cycle of ESHAP. A PET completed on 2025-04-12 demonstrated some
improvement as compared to CAT scan completed during her last
admission in 2018. The 2025-04-12 PET did demonstrate
progression as compared to 2025-01-23. If her disease remains stable
or improved after this cycle of chemotherapy, an autologous stem
cell transplant is still being considered and planned for after
chemotherapy.
- Patient completed her chemotherapy according to ESHAP
protocol: Rituxan 645 mg IV on day 1 (pre-medication with
Tylenol and Benadryl), Etoposide 40 mg/m2 IV on days 9,
Methylprednisolone 500 mg IV on days 8, Cisplatin 25 mg/m2/day
continuous IV on days 13, and cytarabine 1985 mg/m2 IV on day
5.
- She was given a quick two day taper of steroids at time of
discharge.
- Zofran 24 mg was given on days 9 of chemotherapy.
- She was given intravenous normal saline prior to chemotherapy
continuously during chemotherapy.
- She was given predforte eyedrops 1% during and after
chemotherapy, as well as ativan and compazine as needed.
- Due to her history of zoster, prophylaxis with acyclovir was
continued.

Chief Complaint:
""It was stupid and I'm not fucking going to the nut house
again.""

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Per records, pt was picked up last night by EMTs at his home in
Chicago, IL with some police involvement per record; they found pt
agitated but not physical; he was hypoxic to 92% and started on
4L O2. Trip sheet from EMTs who initially picked up patient
reports chief complaint self inflicted stabbing, secondary
complaint EtOH/ SI. He reported alcohol and use of
benzodiazepines, and stated that after verbal dispute with
""another individual, he became upset and proceeded to stab
himself in the chest with a 7-8 cm blade."" Dr. Sean Wolfe
note from 2025-07-30 states, ""per EMS was trying to kill himself.""
Nursing note (typed) says: ""Patient states clearly that he wants
to die."" Head and cspine films at outside hospital were
negative. Small pneumothorax seen on chest CT resulting in
patient being transferred to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) trauma. Patient's VS stable
througout. He was sent here on a Detention hold 57189 at
03:36 AM.

Mr. Sims himself does not recall details of last night on
talking to me, although he spoke in detail about the knife he
used and how he stabbed himself several times to RN Heather Thompson. He
tells me he does not recall stabbing himself but does really not
recall circumstances. He later says he used a steak knife. He
also says he threw a telephone at his wife. He describes having
been in usual state of health until about a week ago when
increasing problems with pain management resulted in what he
calls a ""fucked up cycle"" of more pain, arguing with wife,
wanting to drink, more pain etc. He finally relapsed on alcohol
three days ago after increasing financial arguments with wife
and frustration over pain management. He states his therapist
and psychiatrist were not contacted as he felt they would just
tell him to do breathing exercises. He describes hopelessness,
depressed and anxious mood, problems with concentration, and
anhedonia. No excessive guilt. Chronically poor sleep, appetite
- no recent changes. Reports increasingly frustrated over pain
meds, financial issues and arguments with wife (who he states is
spending all their money on her grandson). 2025-01-22, pt

Brief Hospital Course:
# Legal: DNR
# Medical: The patient had no medical problems while in Deac-4.

# Psychiatric: The patient's most pressing expressed concern
during his hospital stay was his chronic pain. He was initially
treated with dilaudid, but this was eventually replaced by his
home dose of morphine. Throughout his hospital stay, his
anticipated discharge was to a Oncology clinic. However, it
was revealed that his insurance would require a $20 co-pay daily
at the Riverbend Medical clinic, so he was instructed to follow-up with
his own pain clinic at St. Mary's Hospital.

He was continued on Wellbutrin, Trazodone, and his ativan was
changed to 0.5mg BID, as per his home dose. He denied any
thoughts of SI or SIB throughout his hospital stay, continually
explaining the event away as an accident. He underwent
neuropsychiatric testing, which revealed general, moderate
executive impairment. It was explained to the patient that any
significant stress, such as alcohol intoxication, could further
impair his executive functioning and could potentially lead to
poor decisions (e.g., stabbing himself in the chest). He was
agreeable to restarting with AA as his substance abuse
treatment.

# Psychosocial: His wife was unable to visit due to the
restraining order that she filed. On the day of discharge, his
wife visited and took the patient home with her.

Thickenning of bowel wall with fat stranding at distal ileum,
terminal ileum,
and cecum/proximal ascedning colon, which could be seen in
infectious,
inflammatory, or less likely ischemic colitis. Chron disease can
have similar
apperance.

Final Report
HISTORY: 1975 man with three days' abdominal pain and
chills in the
right lower quadrant. IV only and no p.o. contrast. Rule out
appendicitis.

Coronal and sagittal reformatted images are provided.

COMPARISON: Compared to CT 2025-02-04.

FINDINGS: There are no concerning nodules, opacities, or pleural
effusion at
the lung bases.

CT ABDOMEN: The liver has a similar appearance compared to prior
study with
no definite focal lesions identified. The gallbladder, adrenal
glands,
spleen, and pancreas appear within normal limits. The kidneys
enhance
symmetrically have normal size, and excrete contrast
symmetrically without
evidence of focal lesion or hydronephrosis. The appendix is
visualized and
has a normal appearance (2:54,55). There is wall thickening,
wall edema at
loops of distal ileum, terminal ileum, cecum and partially
ascending colon,
301B:26 and 301B:23, with some fat stranding, and prominence of
mesenteric
circulation, which could suggest inflammatory, or infectious
etiology. Please
note that Crohn's can have a similar appearance. Ischemic
etiology can have
similar appearance, however, the distribution is not typical.
There is no free
fluid in the abdomen. There is no free air. There are no
pathologically
enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. There are
some scattered
mesenteric lymph nodes, however, they do not meet the CT
criteria for
pathologic enlargement.

CT PELVIS: The bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles appear
normal. There is
no free fluid in the pelvis. There is no pathologic pelvic or
inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

The osseous structures demonstrate no concerning lytic or
sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION: Wall thickening, and wall edema in distal loops of
ileum,
terminal ileum, and cecum with part of ascending colon, with fat
stranding,
and mesenteric vascularity prominence. Findings suggest Crohn's
diseae
although differential includes other infectious or inflammatory
etiology, and
less likely ischemic. Finding was posted on the ED dashboard,
and
communicated by phone with Dr. Debra Martinez.

PCP: Thomas Lamb NP
PRIMARY ONCOLOGIST: Dr. Susan Hicks
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Pancreatic CA
TREATMENT REGIMEN: gem/nab/cis/paracalcitol with Dr. Timothy Cooper in East Michael

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Hyperbilirubinemia

HISTORY OF PRESSENT ILLNESS:
Dr. Jacqueline Campbell is a 1983 year old male with a past medical
history of metastatic pancreatic cancer who presents with
hyperbilirubinemia found on outpatient laboratory testing.

The patient was recently admitted to Tata Memorial Hospital from East Michael for
monitoring after his outpatient liver biopsy was complicated by
a
hepatic subcapsular hematoma which required a blood transfusion
with 2u pRBC.

Since discharge, the patient had been doing well until 5 days
prior to admission when he noticed the development of dark
urine,
nausea and Brown colored stools. Then 2 days ago while on a
airplane flight to East Michael, he noticed the sudden onset of sharp
Port Mary pain. He was taken to Orthopedic Surgery Department where he was given dilaudid with quick improvement of
his pain. The patient states his laboratory evaluation was wnl.

He has not had any further episodes of pain. However, today, due
to his dark urine, he underwent outpatient laboratory testing in
East Michael which noted a direct hyperbilirubinemia ~7. The patient
called his oncologist who recommended he present to the ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat) Department ED
for further evaluation.

The patient has been without headache or vision changes. In
addition, he is without fevers or chills. No chest pain or
dyspnea. No vomiting or diarrhea. No melena or hematochezia. No
dysuria.

Of note, in anticipation for the potential need for ERCP due to
his symptoms, the patient has not taken his Xarelto x2 days.

In the ED, initial vitals were:
T 98.3 HR 72 BP 114/77 R 16 SpO2 98% RA

negative unless noted above

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Due to his family history of pancreatic cancer and other
malignancies Dr. Jacqueline Campbell was enrolled in a study of Routine vital signs
monitoring and his values had been normal for about 266 years
leading up to 2025-01-19 when he noted some gassiness and had an
abdominal ultrasound which was normal. Screening Chloride: 102 mmol/L was 19
on
2025-01-19. 2025-01-19 he noted more discomfort and burping relieved
by leaning forward. EGD 2025-01-19 showed mild gastritis, h. pylori
negative, and he started a PPI. 2025-01-19 a screening CTA was
performed for New symptoms of his known celiac artery aneurysm
(previous CT was 266 years prior). The aneurysm was stable at
1.6cm but incidentally noted was a 3.5 to 4cm mass in the
pancreatic tail, mesenteric nodules up to 2cm, and multiple
liver
masses up to 2.3cm. CT Chest was without evidence of metastatic
disease.

2025-01-19 CT guided biopsy of his pancreatic mass showed ductal
adenocarcinoma. At UVM Chloride: 102 mmol/L CK was 714 which was chronic and
attributed to his statin, Chloride: 102 mmol/L was 115 and CEA 270. Kidney
and
liver function were normal. Foundation One showed a BRCA2
mutation, this was confirmed as germline by CancerNext through a
familial pancreatic cancer research trial. There was also a
variant of unknown significance in ATM.

Initial visit with us 2025-01-19, he was screened for the HALO
study
and his tumor was HA high, but he was excluded from the trial
for
a PTT at the reference lab just above the cutoff. Screening CT
2025-01-19 here showed the known pancreatic tail mass now suspicious
for early invasion of the stomach, with multiple omental
deposits
increased in size, as well as multiple hepatic lesions
consistent
with metastases. Port placed 2025-01-19.

2025-01-19 he returned from a ski trip to East Michael, had mild shortness
of breath and a CTA at East Michael showed small PE's for which
he started lovenox. At this time he was also having more
abdominal pain/discomfort.

2025-01-19 PTT remained elevated despite vitamin K, lupus
anticoagulant screen was positive although he was on lovenox.

Treatment:
-2025-01-19, FOLFIRINOX C1D1 without neulasta. CA Chloride: 102 mmol/L 687, CEA

collar for comfort. You may remove the collar to take a shower
or eat. Limit your motion of your neck while the collar is off.
You should wear the collar when walking, especially in public
-Wound Care: If the incision is draining cover it with a new
sterile dressing. If it is dry then you can leave the incision
open to the air. Once the incision is completely dry (usually
6 days after the operation) you may take a shower. Do not soak
the incision in a bath or pool. If the incision starts draining
at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet. Call the
office at that time. If you have an incision on your hip please
follow the same instructions in terms of wound care.
-You should resume taking your normal home medications.

Chief Complaint:
Hypotension during HD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Brian with ESRD on HD 2x per week (T/Th/Sat), HTN, HLD, DM2,
history of prior line-associated infections including HD line
candidemia in 1971, sent to ED from outpatient HD unit after
she developed hypotension during her session on 2025-05-15. For
several days prior to admission, patient had nausea and vomiting
after every meal, as well as a sore throat and cough. She
skipped on scheduled HD appointment on 2025-01-14 because she
was feeling unwell. On the day of admission, she was 97.2 kg, 7
kg up from her dry weight of 91 kg. About 15 minutes into her
outpatient HD session, she became hypotensive to SBP 100 (from
180 before that), with a reported oxygen desaturation (unknown
to what degree). At that time, she experienced shortness of
breath and nausea. Very little volume was ultrafiltrated off,
and patient was sent to Fortis Healthcare ED for evaluation. Per report
between outpatient HD and our HD unit, she may have had some
confusion at home as well.

In the ED initial vital signs were: T 99 HR 94 BP 159/67 RR 20
O2 sat 98% on 6L. Oxygen was weaned down to 2 L and then to room
air. Labs were notable for leukocytosis to 21.4 with 43%N, 6%L,
49% E, 1% atypicals, 1% metas; D-dimer 5020; bicarb 16, BUN 57,
Cr 2.9, glucose 113; lactate 1.0; troponin < 0.01. UA was
significant for moderate Ketones, positive nitrites, 12 WBC, many
bacteria. CXR showed possible LLL infiltrate vs. effusion.
Because of reported hypoxia prior to admission, CTA was done to
rule out PE. This showed no PE, but did show some high density
material at lung bases concerning for aspiration. Was given
aztreonam 1 g IV to cover for GNRs with this aspiration. VS
prior to transfer were: 97.9 174/77 84 20 98%.

Patient was sent directly to HD from the ED. When she began HD,
patient was A+O x3, and was able to trasnfer herseld Upon
initation of HD, BP was 179/92. After ultrafiltrating off ~200
cc over 20 minutes, BP dipped to 80/69, at which time patient
experienced nausea and a sensation that she needed to move her
bowels. She required 3L NC for shortness of breath as well.
She was given fluid bolus of 300 cc, along with vanocmycin 1.5 g
IV (in 500 cc fluid). At the end of diaylsis/ultrafiltration,
she was net -900cc. ABG showed: 7.35 / 36 / 62, lactate 1.6.
At the time patient was evaluated in HD for hypotension, her
vitals were BP 107/57, RR 22, HR 107, and SaO2 95% on 3L. She
denied any shortness of breath, chest pain or pleuritic pain at
this time, but was somewhat drowsy.

On arrival to the MICU, initial VS were: T 98.4 BP 150/79 HR
86 RR 31 SaO2 99% 2L.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. Over the past month, patient's daughter noticed a
major change in mood and overall disregard to her health, as
well as detachment from reality; possible denial about health
problems, has expressed desire to stop HD.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest
pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel
habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.

Past Medical History:
- ESRD on HD through tunneled L IJ catheter
- catheter-related blood stream infections, including Candidemia
parapsilosis secondary to HD catheter infection 1971, s/p HD
catheter remocal and line holiday with anitfungal treatmetn
- Complicated access history including LUE fistula but
thrombosed in 1982 and unable to be thrombectomized; then L
forearm loop graft that clotted immediately and was never used
- HTN
- DM2 diet controlled
- Asthma

artery calcifications. 3. 4 mm perifissural nodule in the left
upper lobe. Recommend 12-month followup if no risk factors or
six-month followup if risk factors are present. 4. High-density
material with mild interstitial abnormality at the lung bases,
likely due to aspiration. 5. Multiple collaterals in the
mediastinum and left chest wall may suggest stenosis of the left
brachiocephalic vein.
-CXR 2025-06-20, 11:28 2025-05-29: Previous interstitial edema has
resolved. Moderate cardiomegaly may have improved slightly.
Lungs are clear aside from mild left basal atelectasis. Pleural
effusion is small if any, on the left. No pneumothorax. Dialysis
catheters that end in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
-CXR (2025-06-20): IMPRESSION: Probable atelectasis left base,
possibly with trace pleural fluid. This is essentially unchanged
compared with 2025-06-20. If there is high concern for a
pneumonic infiltrate in this location, then a lateral view may
help for further assessment.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brian with dementia, ESRD (HD T/Th/Sat, HTN, HLD, DM2, history of
prior line-associated infections including HD line candidemia in
1971, who was admitted to the MICU for anaphylaxis/allergic
rxn to HD. She was treated with prednisone, fexofenadine, and
premedicated with diphenhydramine and montelukast for inpatient
HD.

# Hypotension/anaphylaxis to HD: She presented after hypotension
during hemodialysis on 2025-04-24. She was treated with both IV
vancomycin and aztreonam briefly out of concern for sepsis. She
was found to have eosinophilia and elevated tryptase, both
concerning for an allergic/anaphylactic reaction. She received
methylprednisolone and was changed to a prednisone taper. The
hemodialysis/dialysate allergen was not found (RAST antibody
testing for ethylene oxide was negative). She subsequently
tolerated HD without allergic reaction with hypoallergenic
tubing and a premedication regimen of diphenhydramine and
montelukast. She was also started on daily fexofenadine. The
patient remained hemodynamically stable for the remainder of her
hospital stay. She will need to take monteleukast The patient's
premedication regimen for outpatient dialysis were reviewed with
her, and Apollo Medical Center Dialysis is aware of her special dialysis
needs. She will need follow up with her PCP, Brian
Miller, and an allerJanet Giles.

# Hypoxia: Pt with a history of asthma (not on inhaled
medications prior to hospitalization), who presented with
increased oxygen requirement and wheezing on lung exam. No
convincing infiltrate on CXR. CTA ruled out PE. She received
aztreonam briefly for initial suspicion of PNA and also E. coli
UTI. She was switched from methylprednisolone (for above
allergic reaction) to oral prednisone to complete a 14 day
taper. She was treated with albuterol nebulizer therapy, which
improved her wheezing. The patient was also noted to experience
oxygen desaturation when sleeping (down to 85-89% saturation),
which was concerning for obstructive sleep apnea. Notably,
during the day, the patient breathed comfortably on room air.
She was discharged home with albuterol and fluticasone inhalers
and will need to follow up with her PCP regarding sleep apnea
testing/treatment.

# UTI: Initial presentation concerning for evolving sepsis,
given episodes of hypotension with altered mental status.
Patient was noted to have E. coli >100,000 colonies with broad
sensitivity on urine culture 2025-07-29. Patient was treated with
aztreonam for 6 days, and repeat urine culture on 2025-06-24 was
negative. She had no urinary symptoms.

# Cough, chest pain: The patient complained of persistent
coughing during her stay, which was later accompanied by chest
and abdominal pain. EKG was negative for ischemic changes. The
patient's symptoms were concerning for gastroesophageal reflux
disease with possible contributions from chronic
bronchitis/asthma. She was started on ranitidine for GERD and
guaifenesin-codeine as a cough suppressant.

Chronic Issues:

# ESRD: On hemodialysis twice per week (10). The patient
underwent hemodialysis with premedication as described above and
with hypoallergnic tubing on 2025-07-22, and 2025-04-11 without
complication. She was continued on her home Nephrocaps. Through
inpatient dialysis staff, the patient's special premedication
regimen was communicated to Apollo Medical Center Dialysis. Also, there is
concern that the patient is volume overloaded, and she will
follow up with Dr. Eduardo Clay regarding more frequent
hemodialysis.

# Hypertension: Due to hypotension at 2025-06-03, her
amlodipine was initially held and then restarted at 2.5mg daily.

# Hyperlipidemia: She continued her home simvastatin 20 mg PO
qhs.

# Diabetes, type 2: At home, she treats her DM with dietary
control. While hospitalized, she received humalog insulin
sliding scale.

# Incidental Lung Nodule: A 4 mm perifissural nodule in the left
upper lobe was discovered on CT. Of note, the patient has a
history of tobacco use. Further evaluation of this nodule was
deferred to outpatient management, and the patient's PCP was
notified. A repeat CT in 6 months is advised.

# Obstructive sleep apnea: As noted above, the patient
experienced oxygen desaturation to 85-89% during sleep, which
was concerning for OSA. She will need follow up with her PCP for
further evaluation.

Transitional Issues:
- The patient is on a prednisone taper: 10 mg daily from 2025-08-09 to
2025-06-15, then 5 mg daily from 2025-02-28 to 2025-03-23.
- The patient is scheduled for follow up with her PCP, Brian
Miller, on 2025-07-13. The following issues will need to be
discussed at that visit:
(1) The patient will require follow up with an allergist within
the next 2 weeks.
(2) Further evaluation of a left upper lobe lung nodule
discovered incidentally on chest CT.
- The patient will continue HD on 2025-01-13 at Johns Hopkins Clinic Dialysis
with the following recommended modifications: (1) use
hypoallergenic tubing that has been pre-flushed and (2)
premedication with diphenhydramine and montelukast 1 hour prior
to dialysis. She will receive IV diphenhydramine at the dialysis
center. She will need to take montelukast 1 hour prior to
dialysis (montelukast not available at the dialysis center).
Epinephrine will be available in case of anaphylaxis. She will
continue taking fexofenadine daily. These medication changes
have been discussed with the patient.
- The patient will follow up with Dr. Eduardo Clay to
discuss her recent hospitalization and discuss the need for more
frequent hemodialysis.
- The patient will follow up with Dr. David Mullen (pulmonology)
for further evaluation of possible obstructive sleep apnea.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Mccall,

You were hospitalized for having low blood pressure and
decreased oxygen in your blood after having hemodialysis
recently. We think that your episode of low blood pressure was
due to a severe allergic reaction to your hemodialysis. We think
your low blood oxygen was due to sleep apnea. We treated you
with antibiotics briefly because we were concerned about an
infection. We treated you with steroids and allergy medications
to prevent you from having further responses during
hemodialysis. We gave you inhaled medications and oxygen to help
you breathe. We think your coughing and abdominal discomfort may
be due to acid reflux, and we started you on an acid reflux
medication and a medication to reduce your coughing.

We have special instructions that you must follow to prevent you
from having an allergic reaction during dialysis. You will need
to continue taking the steroid medication (prednisone) 10 mg
each day until 2025-06-15. After that, you will need to take 5
mg of prednisone each day from 2025-02-28 to 2025-03-23. Also,
please take fexofenadine (Allegra) every day as instructed.

Also, you will need to take diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and
montelukast (Singulair) 1 hour before you have dialysis. Also,
the tubing that is used in dialysis will need to be flushed
generously with fluid before you use it.

Finally, we noted that your oxygen level is low which we think
is from two causes. You have low oxygen when walking which is
from too much fluid in your lungs, this can be treated with
dialysis and we recommend that you attend dialysis three times
weekly. After long discussion with you, it is clear that you do
not want dialysis this frequently however with your oxygen level
being low when you walk, you are at increased risk for losing
consciousness and falling. For this reason, we recommend that
you use supplemental oxygen during the day. Your oxygen level
also declines while you are asleep and we believe that you have
undiagnosed sleep apena. We recommend that you use supplemental
oxygen at night and follow up with a pulmonologist for
evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea.

Please follow up with your primary care provider, Dr. Dwayne Odom.
Also, please follow up with your nephrologist, Dr. Brian
Miller. Lastly, please follow up with Dr. Christina Davis
(pulmonologist/lung doctor).

MEDICATION CHANGES
START prednisone at 10 mg daily from today until 2025-06-15,
then 5 mg daily from 2025-02-28 to 2025-03-23.
START diphenhydramine at dialysis for severe allergy
START montelukast before dialysis for severe allergy
START fexofenadine for allergies
START ranitidine for acid reflux
START guainefesin-codeine for your cough
START fluticasone for your cough
START albuterol as needed for shortness of breath

Followup Instructions:
Adhere to fluid restrictions to avoid fluid overload."

History of Present Illness:
Jason Pugh is a 1983 male with a past medical history of
morbid obesity, recurrent PEs on Coumadin, diabetes type 2,
aortic stenosis status post TAVR 2025-06-08, CAD with 5 stents most
recent being the LAD in 1981 in 12 and recent
pullback to the LAD (unclear why no stent) at South Richardburgh in 2025-05-07
who presented to Cleveland Health Institute with sudden onset of
shortness of breath after going to the bathroom in the middle
the night. The patient says that he tried taking an aspirin as
well as nitroglycerin that did not help. He then called EMS and
in the meantime had placed himself back on his BiPAP which
slowly helped. When EMS arrived, his O2 sat was 84% on 4 L and
he was briefly placed on a nonrebreather and received a DuoNeb
in route to the hospital. By the time he arrived to Mercy Health Hospital They patient was breathing on room air. Of note
the patient says that he did not take his morning torsemide the
day prior. He also reports that these of the same symptoms that
brought him to
the hospital in 06 and 1982. In the emergency room the
patient was found to have a mildly positive troponin I of 0.321.
He was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital for further work-up
and evaluation. His troponin peaked at 0.06. A TTE was done
which showed anterior lateral wall motion abnormalities. Based
on this and his risk factors they decided to proceed with a
cardiac cath once his INR dropped below 2. The cath revealed no
progression of his disease in comparison with the one that was
done in 2025-03-23. Dr. Jeffery Turner a TEE be done
during the procedure showed the TAVR valve in position however
it showed moderate paravalvular leak at both the posterior and
anterior wall as well as a moderate intra-valvular leak. 3D is
suggestive of possible problem with 1 of the leaflets in
addition to the paravalvular leak. Biventricular systolic
function was normal.
Due to NSTEMI, a heparin drip was restarted post hemostasis and
then used for bridging with his Coumadin. Initially the plan was
to discharge the patient home with outpatient work-up of a
paravalvular leak however his outpatient cardiologist Dr.
Daniel Turner very strongly that the patient needed an
expedited work-up in the inpatient setting to avoid readmission
for heart failure. In discussion with Dr. Jeffery Turner patient was
then transferred to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for further work-up.

TAVR; Interventional Details 2025-08-17
The Sentinel cerebral protection system was inserted via the
right radial artery in a 7 5 Fr slendersheath and using
standard process, the innominate and left carotid were
protected. At the end of the procedure, the device was
successfully recaptured. The patient was counseled extensively
regarding the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure
and after answering all questions, the patient yielded
informed consent. The patient was thereafter brought to the
catheterization laboratory and monitored anesthesia care was
delivered. Preprocedural antibiotic was administered
intravenously. The nature of
this procedure required multidisciplinary planning and
management with the cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology
and anesthesia physicians.
All members of the heart team were present for the following key
components of the procedure according CMS guidelines: Vascular
access Catheter placement, Device implantation, Vascular
closure,
Intraprocedural medication ordering. Sterile technique was used
throughout the case. All vascular access was obtained using
modified Seldinger technique and ultrasound guidance. An 5 Fr
sheath was placed in
the left femoral vein and 5 Fr sheaths were placed in the right
and left femoral artery. The 5 Fr sheath in the right femoral
artery was removed and the arteriotomy was measured with the
Manta device, and the access site was upsized to an 5 Fr sheath. A
6 Fr Angled Pigtail catheter was advanced to the aortic root via
the left femoral artery sheath and aortic root angiography was
performed. A temporary pacing wire was placed in the right
ventricle via the left femoral vein sheath. Next, the 5 Fr sheath
in the right femoral artery was exchanged over an Amplatz
Extrastiff for the 14Dr Gore Dryseal sheath.
The prosthetic valve was crossed from the left femoral artery a
6 Fr Fr multipurpose placed in the left ventricle. Through this
guiding catheter, a 20 mm Goosenecksnare was placed in the LV
along with a 0.018 V-18 wire.
Using a AL2 guiding catheter, a Piggyback catheter, and a
0.014Astato wire, the left coronary valve leaflet was lacerated
with electrocautery and captured with the Gooseneck snare. The
Ostato wire was exteriorized, a Flying V was placed, and the
Flying Vwas readvanced to the left valve leaflet. Using
electrocautery,the left leaflet was lacerated and the catheters
were removed.
After securing the delivery sheath, a pigtail catheter was
advanced to the aortic root. Using a 0.035"" straight wire, the
aortic valve was crossed. Over the wire, the angled pigtail
catheter was advanced across the valve. Baseline hemodynamics
(left heart catheterization) were obtained. A preshaped curved
wire was advanced into the LV . Next, the IV infusion pump delivery system
was delivered to the descending aorta and the balloon positioned
within the valve. We then proceeded to advance the Mechanical valve
to the ascending aorta and to cross the aortic valve in a
retrograde fashion. After confirming appropriate placement across the Port Teresaburgh using aortic root angiogaphy, the Mechanical
valve was deployed with rapid ventricular pacing at 180 bpm.
Complications: There were no clinically significant
complications.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Pugh,

It was a pleasure taking care of They at the Massachusetts General Hospital
Johns Hopkins Clinic.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?
==========================
- They presented to hospital for an evaluation of your aortic
valve.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?
==============================
- They were seen by the Structural Heart Team.
- They had a cardiac CT, which showed a left lower lobe nodule.
This is larger in comparison to CT in 2025-04-03. This should be
followed with a dedicated CT, It also revealed a thyroid
nodule. This should be followed with an ultrasound. This
information has been sent to your physicians.
- They had a transfemoral aortic valve repair (valve in valve)
on 2025-05-01

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
================================
- Follow up with your doctors as listed below
- Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below).

Your weight on discharge is 155.2 kg/342.1 LB. Please weigh
yourself daily. If your weight increases 3 pounds overnight
please take torsemide 20 mg and call Dr. 95 kg

They Gabapentin was decreased to 200 mg daily due to the elevated
kidney function. Please have labs checked with either Dr.
Follow diabetic diet instructions carefully and monitor blood sugar levels twice daily. in the next week to confirm that this
has improved and that it is safe to increase the Gabapentin.

If They were given any prescriptions on discharge, any future
refills will need to be authorized by your outpatient providers,
primary care or cardiologist.

It was a pleasure participating in your care.

If They have any urgent questions that are related to your
recovery from your hospitalization or are concerning to They and They think They may need
to return to the hospital, please call the Guyâs and St. Thomasâ Hospital HeartLine at
+918618050244 to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse
practitioner.

Chief Complaint:
weight gain, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Atrial flutter ablation

History of Present Illness:
1972 male with a PMHx of paroxysmal atrial flutter who
presented to Apollo Indraprastha Hospital from his PCP's office with
tachycardia. Several weeks ago he noticed his abdomen getting
larger and distended to the point that he could not get into his
car. He went to his PCP who noted Patient is alert HR in the 150s. He was sent
to the Apollo Indraprastha Hospital ED for further evaluation. At Apollo Indraprastha Hospital he was started on
IV diltiazem drip and was given IV lasix for CHF exacerbation.
Cardiology was consulted and per their recommendations he was
started on metoprolol, changed to oral diltiazema, and apixaban
for anticoagulation. He was noted to be atrial flutter, and his
HR was controlled with these interventions. For CHF
exacerbation, diuresis was uptitrated to 80mg IV TID.
Echocardiogram showed EF of 45%. Dr. Maria Jones was called and
accepted the patient to transfer to Apollo Indraprastha Hospital for possible ablation.

ROS: On review of systems, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for dypsnea with minimal
exertion, 2 pillow orthopnea at baseline but now has to sleep
sitting in the chair, worsening leg edmea, and occasional
palpitations when his HR is near the 200s (not currently). He
dneies chest pain, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension

STUDIES:
=======================
LEFT 2025-04-01 Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: The peroneal veins were not
visualized. Otherwise, no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
the left lower extremity veins.

CXR 2025-04-01: Heart is moderately enlarged. Mediastinal widening
to the right of the trachea to the level of the aortic arch is
due to venous engorgement or adenopathy. Opacification of the
right lower lung could be asymmetric edema, but pneumonia or
aspiration should be considered first. If there is any pleural
effusion it is not large. There is no pneumothorax.

TTE 2025-04-01: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage
ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus seen in the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or right atrium/right atrial
appendage. Depressed biventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Brown is a 1972 with a PMHx of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
obesity, type 2 diabetes and OSA presenting as a transfer from
an OSH with atrial flutter and CHF exacerbation.

# Atrial Flutter/fibrillation: Pt has history of paroxysmal
atrial flutter, with superimposed atrial fibrillation, which had
become more frequent, and caused acute systolic congestive heart
failure. Transferred from OSH on diltiazem 90 QID, metoprolol
75mg q6h, and apixaban. Remained in atrial flutter/fibrillation
with HRs in the 110s and bursts to the 150s, which were
asymptomatic. Underwent aflutter ablation, which successfully
converted patient into sinus rhythm. Ablation complicated by
post-procedure hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of fluid
overload and myocardial stunning. Patient transferred to the CCU
on BIPAP, aggressively diuresed and titrated down to baseline 5L
O2 and transferred back to the floor. Converted to afib and
susequently loaded with amiodarone and converted to sinus.
Discharged in sinus rhythm on 75mg metoprolol tartrate TID,
amiodarone 400mg daily x 1 week, then 200mg daily. Will need
apixaban 5mg BID for at least a month for a CHADS score at least
3.

# Acute systolic congestive heart failure: Pt noted increasing
abdominal girth, lower extremity edema. Found to have volume
overload from left and right-sided heart failure with EF of 45%
(last known 55%). No known CAD. Given chronic skin changes on
abdomen and diffuse chronic edema, likely progressing for a
while. Diuresed on lasix drip, transitioned to IV bolus, then PO
lasix. Received two days of acetazolamide for elevated bicarb
during diuresis. Discharged on lasix 80mg BID. Admission weight:
201.kg, Discharge weight 178.3kg.

# Hypoxia: Pt noted to be hypoxemic in Toddville and has been on
increasing oxygen requirements, up to 5L at home. No further
workup done as outpatient. No evidence of PE on CTA. Likely
large component is from fluid overload and obesity
hypoventilation. Improved with diuresis. Discharged on room air.
Will follow up with outpatient pulmonologist as needed.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Morbid obesity: Pt morbidly obese, interested in bariatric
surgery. Lost >30 lbs with diuresis.

# OSA: CPAP with RT consult

# Hypertension: Lisinopril originally held. Controlled with
diltiazem and lasix. Dsicharged on lisinopril 5mg daily.

# TII DM: Last HGBA1C 7.3 2025-03-11. Held home metformin and
used HISS while hospitalized

# Asthma
- Continue albuterol prn

# Insomnia
- Continue zolpidem qHS:prn

=====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
- Underwent atrial flutter ablation
- Post ablation, in sinus rhythm, that then converted to Afib
- Started on amiodarone for afib, converted to sinus, did not
get cardioversion
- Discharge on Amiodarone 400mg daily, will transition to 200mg
Amiodarone daily on 2025-07-26
- D/c on Metoprolol 75mg TID
- Apixaban for at lease 1 month post ablation(end date 2025-06-07.
Course will be determined by outpatient cardiolgist.
- Financial issues: Pt does not have prescription coverage, all
medications at discharge were covered by Medicaid $4 plan except
Apixaban and Amiodarone. We were able to get 2 weeks of Apixaban
coverage, with the rest to be obtained by PCP.
- discharge on room air- 94% RA
- Consider outpatient pulmonology followup

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Brown,

It was a pleasure taking care of They at Apollo Indraprastha Hospital.
They were transferred to Apollo Indraprastha Hospital to help further manage your
Atrial Flutter/fibrillation. They were also found to have some
fluid overload caused by congestive heart failure. It is
believed that the congestive heart failure was caused by your
irregular heart beats. They were given medicine to help They lose
water weight.

They underwent a flutter ablation, which successfully stopped the
irregular heart beats. However, your oxygen level and blood
pressure were low after the procedure and They were transferred
to the ICU. Your oxygen level improved to your normal level, and They were transferred back to the floor.

They were discharged from the hospital with new medications to
control your heart rate and fluid. They will take a blood thinner
medication for 1 month after your procedure.

They should adhere to a low calorie diet and continue researching
bariatric surgery. It is important that They weight yourself each
day and call your doctor if They gain more than 3 pounds in a day
or 5 pounds in 2 days.

Sincerely,

Your medical team at Apollo Indraprastha Hospital

IMAGING:
=========
2025-04-02 CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. Distended loop of small bowel in the pelvis with an acute
transition point concerning for small bowel obstruction. This
is similar in appearance when compared to recent prior however
intraluminal contents are now more fecalized. Overall, however
the more proximal small bowel loops are more decompressed and
improved compared to last exam from 2025-07-26.
2. Bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter, right worse than
left, worse since 2025-07-26. Delayed excretion of contrast
of the right kidney, concerning for obstruction. Correlation
with functioning of the nephrostomy tube suggested.
3. Findings compatible with diffuse peritoneal and liver
metastases, not
significantly changed since prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
Davis with metastatic serous ovarian cancer s/p TAH/BSO 2025-05-19 c/b
obstructive nephropathy requiring bilateral PCN, with multiple
recent admissions for SBO presenting with nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain concerning for recurrent bowel obstruction.

# Recurrent Small Bowel Obstruction: Appears to be resolving
with better symptom control but still no flatus. Last BM 2025-04-02 12:15 AM, last flatus 12:15 AM am at time of admission on 2025-04-02.
Recurrent from 3 weeks ago, likely caused by the same pelvic
tumor.
Initially, conservative management kept NPO without need for
NGT. Gyn-Onc was consulted and it was determined there was no
need for surgical intervention. Davis began having soft loose
bowel movements with increasing frequency. Initially presumed to
be post SBO bowel movements. Persisted x 2 days and a C. diff
was performed which was negative. Stools increased in bulk and
decreased in frequency over next 12 hours.
During this time her diet was advanced very slowly to full,
regular, low fiber which she tolerated without n/v for over 48
hours.

# Orthostatic hypotension: Likely volume depletion Medication reaction to poor
PO intake. Bolused with 1L NS on 2025-04-02 after symptoms and
+orthostatics. With adequate volume resuscitation she was no
longer orthostatic, but over time she would repeatedly become
orthostatic. It was determined that she would require PICC at
home for PRN rehydration which she and her husband were amenable
to.

# Heart Failure: Resolved, with Cr back to baseline of 1.0. While most
likely etiology is pre-renal based on physical exam, also
possibility for post-obstructive with PCN dysfunction. Admission
imaging is further notable for bilateral hydroureter R>L.
Notably, both tubes draining without complication at time of
discharge.

# Ovarian Cancer: Metastatic to peritoneum, omentum, liver. S/p
radiation and several cycles of chemotherapy. Recently
discontinued palliative gemcitabine due to lack of response.
Evaluating clinical trials.
- No cancer-directed treatment at this time

CODE: Do not resuscitate (DNR/DNI) confirmed with patient and

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms Davis,

It was a pleasure meeting you and taking care of you. You were
admitted with a recurrent small bowel obstruction. This was
treated with bowel rest, IV fluids, and pain medicines. This
gradually improved and your diet was advanced slowly until you
were able to tolerate a regular diet. You were seen by the
gynecology-oncology team who felt that you did not need surgery.
They recommended that you adhere to a low fiber diet. The
inpatient dieticians saw you to give more information about
this.
In order to keep you at home and feeling well in case of
another small bowel obstruction, you had a long term IV placed
to allow you to receive IV fluids at home. You will be followed
by hospice at home and by Dr. Sierra Brown DDS.

Thank you for letting us participate in your care,
Your Surgery team

Chief Complaint:
Elective RHC with planned milrinone taper

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Foley catheter placement and removal

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Morales is a 1977 year-old man with a past medical history of
newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy with profound global
biventricular contractile dysfunction (LVEF 10%), Afib w/ RVR on
apixiban, EtOH abuse, presenting for planned readmission for RHC
and milrinone weaning.

Patient being admitted for planned elective right heart
catheterization followed by admission to CCU for Milrinone
weaning. Patient underwent RHC with swan left in place in the
RIJ. Cath demonstrated similar to numbers to those from 2025-07-10:
Wedge 10, RA 6, CO 6.6 from 7.5. He denies chest pain, SOB,
dizziness, lightheadedness prior to admission.

Patient was recently admitted to Toronto General Hospital for DOE, tachycardia and
peripheral edema found to have newly diagnosed dilated
cardiomyopathy with profound global biventricular contractile
dysfunction (LVEF 10%) with cardiogenic shock complicated by
newly diagnosed afib w/ RVR (converted to SR, on amiodarone).
TTE showed profound global biventricular contractile dysfunction
(LVEF 10%) and 3+ mitral regurgitation. Cardiomyopathy most
likely secondary to alcohol abuse, although may have a component
of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Pt was started on
Milrinone due to concern for poor
contractility. PA line removed 2025-04-17 (last of numbers: CO 6.0 CI

2.8 SVR 522, lactate 1, MVO2 69). PICC was placed and pt
discharged on milrinone with a plan to re-admit now for
attempted wean. Also discharged on Digoxin, Lisinopril and
Spironolactone.

On the floor, patient denies chest pain, SOB, dizziness,
lightheadedness. He says he is generally feeling well.

IMAGING
=======
+ TTE:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 176/86 mmHg mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (biplane LVEF = 48 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation.] The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Marked left ventricular cavity dilation with mild
global hypokinesis. Severe aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review of
2025-07-04, the severity of aortic regurgitation is increased and
the left venticular cavity is more dilated. Global systolic
function is improved.

+ CXR (2025-01-19): In comparison with the study of 2025-06-16,
there is an placement of right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter that
extends to the outer and mediastinal border of the right
pulmonary artery. Left subclavian PICC line extends to the mid
portion the SVC. No evidence of pneumothorax, pneumonia, or
vascular congestion.

+ EKG (2025-03-17): NSR, no ischemic changes

# CORONARIES: non-obstructive disease
# PUMP: profound global biventricular contractile dysfunction
(LVEF 10%) and 3+ mitral regurgitation
# RHYTHM: NSR

# Acute decompensated heart failure: EF 10%, dry weight ~93KG
Patient admitted for RHC and milrinone weaning following
pervious admission for cardiogenic. Previous TTE showed profound
global biventricular contractile dysfunction (LVEF 10%) and 3+
mitral regurgitation. Cardiomyopathy most likely secondary to
alcohol abuse, although may have a component
of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Started on Milrinone due to
concern for poor contractility. Successfully discontinued
milrinone with good numbers on swan (recorded above)
PRELOAD: held torsemide 40
AFTERLOAD: lisinopril 30, spironolactone 25, succinate 12.5
daily
INOTROPY: digoxin 0.125 daily

# AFIB W/ RVR
Prior hospitalization notable for newly diagnosed atrial
fibrillation with RVR. CHADS2 score 1 (for CHF). RVR likely
triggered by alcohol abuse. Pt cardioverted with TEE but
quickly reverted; successfully cardioverted with amiodarone and
has remained in sinus rhythm. Amiodarone loading finished 2025-05-25.
Continued on apixaban 5mg BID, amiodarone 200mg daily, digoxin
0.125 daily

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Decompensated liver disease
Pt found to have newly diagnosed liver disease at prior
admission likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis and congestive
hepatopathy in setting of poor cardiac function. Duplex RUQUS
showed echogenic liver consistent with steatotis with patent
hepatic vasculature and small volume ascites. Liver function
tests normal this admission. Transitional: follow up with
hepatology for EGD for esophageal varices screening.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Morales,

Thank you for choosing to receive your care at Cleveland Health Institute. You were
admitted to wean off your milrinone. This was successfully
weaned, with your cardiac numbers demonstrating appropriate
response to being off the medication and an echocardiogram
showing nearly intact heart function, although some back-flow
through one of the valves in your heart.

We have made some slight adjustments to your medications, and
you should take them at home exactly as listed. You have been
scheduled for follow-up appointments, listed below, which you
should attend; this includes an appointment with a cardiac
surgeon to evaluate whether it would be appropriate to fix the
leaky valve in your heart.
It is important that you weigh yourself every morning; call your
cardiologist if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

We wish you the best with your ongoing recovery.

Sincerely,

Your Urology Department care team

IMAGING:
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS 2025-03-05
1. Diffuse wall thickening of colon, most pronounced in the
cecum, compatible
with colitis.
2.  Innumerable small hypodense lesions scattered throughout the
liver, which
appear increased in size and number compared to the prior CT of
the
abdomen/pelvis from 2025-06-13.
3.  Approximately 2.6 x 2.2 cm hypodense mass within the
pancreatic neck with
marked upstream ductal dilatation in the pancreatic body and
tail, compatible
with known adenocarcinoma, overall unchanged from prior.
4. Near complete thrombosis of the portal confluence, unchanged
from prior. 6
mm linear focus of thrombus within the main portal vein, which
is otherwise
patent.  Complete thrombosis of the anterior branch of the right
portal vein.
Small caliber posterior branch of the right portal vein with
nonocclusive
thrombus along the wall.
5. Multiple radiopaque pills within the small bowel segment in
the central
pelvis at the site of anastomosis.

DUPLEX DOPPLER US ABDOMEN/PELVIS 2025-05-26
1. New left hepatic portal vein occlusion.
2. Unchanged right anterior hepatic portal vein occlusion and
partial main
portal vein occlusion.
3. The known pancreatic body mass is better appreciated on
recent CT with
unchanged extrinsic occlusion of the portal confluence.
4. Innumerable hepatic lesions are better characterized on
recent CT.
5. Trace perihepatic ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Samantha Ellis is a 1987 year-old woman with a history of
Stage IIIC high-grade serous ovarian cancer s/p debulking and 6
cycles of IP/IV cisplatin/taxol (last 2025-02-22) subsequently
diagnosed with stage IB pancreatic adenocarcinoma s/p whipple
with positive margins at SMA s/p CK followed by
Capecitabine/Gemcitabine with recently diagnosed recurrent
pancreatic cancer with mets to the liver now on FOLFIRINOX 2025-02-28 portal vein thrombosis admitted with typhlitis and
neutropenia likely secondary to FOLFIRINOX, now with resolution
of neutropenia s/p neupogen. Typhlitis was treated with
vancomycin/zosyn and then transitioned to cipro/flagyl when
neutropenia and diarrhea/abdominal pain resolved. Her
antibiotics course will end on 2025-05-30.

#Typhlitis: Patient developed diarrhea and abdominal pain soon
after initiating FOLFIRINOX. CT Ab/Pelvis 2025-03-05 showed colitis,
which in the setting of severe neutropenia was consistent with
typhlitis. Infectious diarrhea was less likely given onset of
symptoms after FOLFIRINOX. C. difficile was negative. She was
treated with vanc/zosyn and antidiarrheal medications. After
resolution of neutropenia s/p neupogen and resolution of
abdominal pain/diarrhea, she was transitioned PO cipro/flagyl
abx to complete a 14 day course which will end on 2025-05-30.
Antibiotics course:
--Zosyn 2025-02-16 - 2025-03-13
--Vancomycin 2025-02-06 - 2025-03-02
--PO Ciprofloxacin 750 mg Q12H /MetroNIDAZOLE 500 mg Q8H to
complete 14 day course 2025-01-26 - 2025-06-13

#Pancytopenia
#Severe neutropenia
On admission, WBC was 0.4 and ANC 0.01. Of note, the neutropenia
is in the setting of receiving Neulasta with FOLFIRINOX on 2025-05-09.
She required intermittent pRBC transfusions early during
admission, with subsequent stabilization of hematocrit. No
evidence of active bleeding, pt denied hematuria/ hematochezia.
Indirect bilirubin not elevated and haptoglobin was wnl,
reducing concern for hemolysis. She required platelet
transfusions throughout admission. At discharge, her platelet
level was stable at 38 without transfusions. She was started on
neupogen 2025-05-03, and neutropenia resolved. Likely etiology is
myelosuppression in the setting of recent FOLFIRINOX. She did
develop pruritis and hives with transfusions (no anaphylactic
symptoms), so she was pre-treated subsequently with allegra and
Tylenol with good effect. Her WBC was 14.8 and ANC was 11.99 at
discharge, most likely secondary to neupogen. She had no
signs/symptoms of new infection.

# Transaminitis:
# Hyperbilirubinemia: Likely 1991 pancreatic cancer mets
diffusely involving her liver v. secondary to hepatotoxicity
from FOLFIRINOX. Bilirubin continued to elevate, and RUQUS
showed new left hepatic vein occlusion and unchanged right
hepatic vein occlusion. She was started on heparin drip on 2025-05-25,
transitioned to lovenox 60mg BID on 2025-08-14. No evidence of bleeding
throughout admission. LFTs, alk phos, and total bilirubin were
stable at discharge.

# Portal vein thrombus: Likely secondary to recurrent disease.
Notably also has history of DVT. She was started heparin on 2025-05-25,
transitioned to lovenox on 2025-08-14, as above.

#Recurrent pancreatic cancer: Recently diagnosed with recurrent
pancreatic cancer with mets to the liver. Patient on palliative
FOLFIRINOX (2025-02-28) with neulasta.

#Hyponatremia: Urine lytes showed FeNa 0.3% but UNa 72,
consistent with with mixed process likely SIADH with
superimposed pre-renal process in the setting of her diarrhea.
Na was 136 at discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Pancreatic insufficiency: Continue home zenpeps with meals

# Malnutrition: Secondary to cancer.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=============================
-Patient will complete a 14 day course of cipro/flagyl for
typhlitis, with last day on 2025-05-30.
-Platelets on discharge were stable at 38. Please recheck CBC at
outpatient oncology appointment. Hemoglobin was stable at 9.1 at
discharge Notably, patient is on lovenox for portal vein
thrombosis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Samantha Ellis,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having
abdominal pain nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. When you were
admitted, your white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelet
levels were all very low. This was caused by your chemotherapy.
We gave you red blood cells and platelets to keep your levels
up. We also gave you a medication called neupogen to increase
your white blood cell count. You responded very well to this
treatment. When you were discharged, your platelet levels were
stable.

Your diarrhea was caused by colitis. This was also because of
your chemotherapy. We treated the colitis with antibiotics. You
should continue to take antibiotics when you go home until
2025-05-30.

It was a privilege to participate in your care, and we wish you
all the best.

Sincerely,
Your Pathology team

Cycle 2. No issues since. (Note sched 3 was delayed as pt
presented as scheduled but was found to have the flu).

Tolerated his last cycle well and states that since then he has
had no issue. The folliculitis on his leg continues resolving
and
is no longer bothersome. Note that he developed a severe
mucositis felt Intracranial Hemorrhage methotrexate and hand cracking/dryness/rash
which derm felt was likely acral erythema secondary to
methotrexate of the hands. Betamethasone ointment was used.
Symptoms have resolved. Pt also denies any fevers, cough,

point ROS neg.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
His neurologic problem began in early 2004 when his
personality changed. He became withdrawn and stayed in bed for
one week. He experienced episodes of sweating. On 2025-05-31, he
woke up and noted that his right hand was not his. Later, he
experienced numbness and within 48 hours, the numbness migrated
to his right thigh and right foot, as well as to his right lip,
right shoulder and right chest later. He thought he had a stroke
and he took two aspirins at a time about 3 times. He was seen in
the emergency department at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore.
Neuroimaging there reviewed a mass in the corpus callosum
involving the right medial brain as well as the sella. He was
transferred to the emergency department at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore. He was
admitted to neurosurgery and gadolinium-enhanced head MRI
performed on 2025-05-31 showed enhancing mass at the body of the
corpus callosum extending to the suprasellar region. He had a
stereotaxic brain biopsy on 2025-07-08.
The
frozen section showed small round blue cell tumor. The final
pathology was B cell lymphoma. He then started induction
high-dose methotrexate @ 3.5 grams/m2 on 2025-05-31. He tolerated
treatment well and underwent C2 of induction high-dose
methotrexate @ 6 grams/m2 on 2025-05-31. Few days after completion
of C2 of HD-MTX he developed he developed skin peeling on his
fingers and tongue, bilateral lower extremity edema and increased
agitation and insomnia in the context of taking 16 mg
dexamethasone BID instead of 4mg as prescribed. His dexamethasone
was held and restarted on 2025-05-31 at 4mg daily. His cabergoline
was discontinued on 2025-05-31 and he was started on Miracle
mouthwash mucositis. On 2025-05-31 he underwent punch biopsy by Dr.
Rachel Lee of Lake Theresa, pathology was bacterial
folliculitis of the right mid shin and irritated pigmented
seborrheic keratosis of the left superior shin. As per
dermatology his bilateral distal hands xerosis and fissuring was
likely acral erythema in the setting of high-dose methotrexate.
He had dramatic response to treatment and is doing well. He was
admitted on 2025-05-31 for high-dose methotrexate treatment but
unfortunately he developed the flu and treatment was held. He saw
Dr. Rachel Lee in clinic on 2025-05-31 and reported right arm paresthesia
and his dexamethasone dose was increased from 2 mg daily to 4mg
twice.

Treatment History:
(1) a stereotaxic brain biopsy by Dr. Rachel Lee on
2025-05-31 showing B cell lymphoma,
(2) started induction C1 high-dose methotrexate on 2025-05-31,
(3) received induction C2 high-dose methotrexate on 2025-05-31,
(4) a visit to emergency department at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore on 2025-05-31
for extremity swelling and skin breakdown,
(5) discontinuation of cabergoline on 2025-05-31, and
(6) punch biopsy by dermatology by Dr. Rachel Lee on
2025-05-31.
(7) 2025-05-31 admitted to Oncology Hospitalist Service for C3
induction HD-MTX @ 3.5 grams/m2 but treatment held because he had
flu.
(8) 2025-05-31 admitted to Oncology Hospitalist Service for C3
induction HD-MTX @ 3.5 grams/m2
now admitted 2025-07-12 for C4 MTX

who was is admitted for fevers, fatigue, hyperglycemia, and
possible central line infection. He presented to Apollo Medical Center clinic
today to receive hydration after complaining of one week of poor
po intake, fatigue, and chills with no fevers. It was noted that
his left sided port had an opening approximately 2 inches with
purulent drainage. Per the patient and his wife, they have noted
erythema and some drainage over the last week. He was sent
directly to same day surgery and had his port removed. The
drainage was swabbed and reportedly the tip of his port was sent
for culture although it is not currently pending in the
computer. He was then sent to the ED for further evaluation.
Labs were remarkable for leukocytosis with left shift (although
not dramatically changed from prior check one month ago), anemia
with Hct of 25, hyperglycemia, and hyponatremia.

In the ED, intial vitals were 99.9, 150/82, 96, 18, 97% RA.
Patient received 4L of NS, 1 gram vancomycin, 1 gram of
cefepime. He also received 7 units of IV insulin. Upon arrival

one week of fatigue, decreased appetite, dizziness with change
in position and ambulating, nausea, occasional vomiting without
blood, abdominal pain (unchanged), and DOE with stairs since
starting chemo.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Final Report
HISTORY: 1995 male with metastatic pancreatic cancer,
undergoing
chemotherapy. Now presenting with leukocytosis and fever,
without a
definitive source. Evaluate for possible intra-abdominal
abscess.

TECHNIQUE: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV and p.o. contrast.
MDCT-acquired
axial images from the base of the neck to the pubic symphysis
are displayed in
5-mm slice thickness. Sagittally and coronally reformatted
images are
displayed in 5- mm slice thickness.

COMPARISON: CT torso with IV contrast on 2025-02-19.

FINDINGS:

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a small pleural effusion on
the right.
There is new hazy-patchy opacity of the right lung base, and
similar hazy-
patchy opacity in lesser degree at the left lung base. These
findings are
likely atelectasis, but superinfection cannot be ruled out.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: In the liver, the known metastasis
are slightly
larger in size compared to the prior study. There is linear
hypodensity,
representing either biliary dilation or extension of tumor. The
mass seen at
the tail of the pancreas, measuring 2.5 cm x 3 cm, is not
significantly
different from the prior study. Again seen is tumor encasing of
splenic
artery.

There are bilateral polycystic kidneys with multiple large
cysts. Some of the
cysts have high Hounsfield unit, may represent hemorrhagic
cysts. However,
metastasis or primary tumor cannot be excluded. There is no
significant
lymphadenopathy seen in the abdomen. There is no evidence of
intra-abdominal
abscess. There is no free fluid in the abdomen.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is contrast seen in the colon
with normal
fecal matter and gas. The small bowel appears normal. There is a
small
calcific density seen in the mesocolon subjacent to the
abdominal wall without
soft tissue involvement. This finding likely represents a
nonspecific
calcified lymph node. There is no evidence of pelvic abscess.
There is no
free fluid in the pelvis.

BONES: There are degenerative changes in the lower lumbar. There
is no
suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.

Brief Hospital Course:
1995 yo Male w/ advanced pancreatic cancer presenting to clinic
line infection, anemia, and hyperglycemia.

Comfort Measures: Discussed down with family and pt with palliative
team to discuss management based on pt's CT scans. Pt and family
members state that he would like to be comfortable and avoid any
interventions that would prolong life without quality
improvement. Pt is now DNR/DNI comfort measures. Pt is currently
on a PO regimen of MS 1989 for baseline pain control and PO
Morphine Instant Release for breakthrough pain. Pt prefers oral
pain medication over IV medication. Pt also complained of some
anxiety overnight, frequency of ativan increased to every 6
hours tohelp.

Nutrition: Over the weekend pt has had difficulty swallowing, pt
now on regular diet pureed, thin liquid diet. Pt's family may
bring in food the pt desires.

CODE STATUS: Pt declared himself DNR/DNI, Comfort Measures Only

Attending: Tony Wallace

Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Oconnor is a 2023 yo m with no significant PMH who presents
with two weeks of intermittent chest pressure. Chest pressure is
located in the middle of his chest and is only present with
exertion (specifically during spinning classes). Pain never
exceeds a 4 out 10 and resolves with rest. Over the past two
weeks his chest pressure has become more predictable, present
with all exercise. He also has developed some mild shortness of
breath and upper airway wheezing that he calls ""slight stridor""
during these episodes. He denies dizziness, nausea, vomiting,
loss of consciousness, or difficulty swallowing. He denies any
history of acid reflux or indigestion. He denies association of
chest discomfort with diet or medications.
.
In the ED, VS: T 97.6 HR 80 BP 134/83 RR 16 SpO2 99%. On arrival
to the ED he complained of 4/10 (moderate) chest pressure. This pressure
resolved with a tablet of sublingual ntg and aspirin 325 mg. CXR
performed was unremarkable. Cardiac enzymes were negative x 2.
EKG remained without ischemic changes. Chest pain returned
multiple times throughout ED admission but never exceeded 4/10 (moderate)
pain. In total he recieved 4 tablets of sublingual ntg and GI
cocktail prior to transfer to the medical floor.
.
On arrival to the floor, he denies any current chest pressure.
He states his last episode was about 7 pm. He states that he
still has a strange sensation in his throat and some residual
sensation of faint wheezing or stridor. He denies fever, chills,
night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion,
sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation.

EKG changes. Nuclear report sent separately.

Nuclear stress:
INTERPRETATION:
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the left ventricular myocardium.
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 61% and EDV
is 94ml.
IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left
ventricular size and systolic function with LVEF 61%

Brief Hospital Course:
2023 yo m with no significant medical history presents with
intermittent chest pain.

# Chest pain: Patient history of progessive chest pressure with
exertion and relief with rest and ntg is concerning of ACS.
Patient has no known cardiac disease or cardiac risk factors.
His first two sets of cardiac enzymes in the ED were negative
and no ischemic changes were identified on EKG. More recent
symptoms of faint wheeze/stridor and throat fullness suggest
esophageal pathology (i.e reflux or spasm). He was ruled out
for an MI with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes. There
were no events on telemetry. A stress test was negative for
iscemic changes. He did have some symptoms while on the
treadmill and it was thought he may have an element of reactive
airway disease versus esophogeal pathology. Further work-up as
an outpatient is warrented.

Medication changes:
He was started on an H2 blocker for possibility of GERD
symptoms.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hosptial because of chest pain. Your
blood was tested over time for evidence of a heart attack. You
did not have a heart attack. There was some concern that you
may still have heart disease so a stress test was done. While
you did have chest pain when exercising there were no
abnormalities in the test. You should continue to take your
aspirin every day for heart protection as well as eat well and
exercise. Talk to your doctor about looking for other causes of
your chest pain such as GERD or esophogeal spasm.

Medication changes:
Ranitidine twice a day for possible GERD symptoms.

Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have
temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening
difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.

Chief Complaint:
bilateral thigh weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2025-03-27: bilateral external iliac artery stents

History of Present Illness:
Followed for multifactorial leg pain. He describes it as an
upper thigh,
buttock fatigue and heaviness. It is not a true pain. It is
okay with standing. He does get some back pain with known
spinal
stenosis. He still continues to be off cigarettes. It does go
away with rest. He had an ultrasound today, which showed an
ABI 0.73 on the right and 0.47 on the left. Both femoral
waveforms are diminished and
this is compared to study of a year ago.
Decision was made to do an angiogram and
see if he has iliac or hypogastric artery disease or potentially
even proximal femoral artery disease and then base treatment on
that.

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Appendectomy
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, left upper lobe
blebectomy, mechanical and chemical (1 g doxycycline)
pleurodesis.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 1982 yo male, who is known to the thoracic surgery
service. He had previously been seen in General City Hospital for recurrent
spontaneous right pneumothorax. At that time, he was taken to
the operating room, but had a PEA arrest, which lasted 45 seconds
seconds. A chest tube was able to be placed at that time, and he
had a talc pleurodesis at that time. He states that he had
recurrent episodes of pneumonia, and was hospitalized between
2025-04-24 and 2025-03-24. He was readmitted in 2025-05-20 again for pneumothorax.
He was taken to the OR for a VATS right blebectomy and chest
tube placement. He had a recurrent leak and was discharged with
two
chest tubes, which were removed without incident.

For his current visit, he states that his granddaughter lives
with him, and has had flu like symptoms. He also states that for
the past 35 days he has also had cold like symptoms,
generalized fatigue, and had felt congested. Of note, he states
that his PCP had treated him for pneumonia with 10 days of
levofloxacin. He states that he coughed up some phlem, which
helped him breath. However, he states that he continued to have
shortness of breath after that short time of relief. He went to
an OSH and had a chest x-ray, which showed a left basilar
pneumothorax. They placed a 28 French chest tube chest tube and he was
transferred to Guyâs and St. Thomasâ Hospital for further management. At the time of
examination, he states that his breathing has improved greatly
since the chest tube had been placed. He currently denies having
any chest pain. However, during the exam he became tachypneic
and tachycardic while speaking. This did resolve when he was at
rest.

CXR 2025-07-02
No pneumothorax. Hyperinflated lungs compatible with emphysema

CTA CHEST 2025-02-25
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Status post left chest tube placement without residual
pneumothorax. Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema at the
left lateral chest wall and tiny pneumomediastinum.
3. Severe emphysema.
4. Partially imaged renal lesions arising from the upper pole of
the left kidney. These are unchanged in size and likely
represent proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cysts. Consider
non-emergent renal ultrasound for further evaluation.

CXR 2025-07-02
No relevant change as compared to the previous examination. The
position of the left chest tube is unchanged. The lungs
continue to be hyper expanded, likely caused by a combination of
emphysema and apical bullous disease. No pleural effusions.
Normal size of the heart.

CXR 2025-07-02 (CT to waterseal)
No significant interval change. No pneumothorax.

CXR 2025-07-02 (post-op)
As compared to the previous radiograph, 2 0 new left-sided chest
tubes have been inserted. There is no visible pneumothorax. Air
collection in the left lateral soft tissues. Unchanged normal
appearance of the heart. Unchanged appearance of the right lung.

CXR 2025-07-02
Status post pleurodesis. 2 left-sided chest tubes are in situ.
Minimal decrease in extent of the soft tissue air collection.
No larger pneumothorax is noted. Could expansion of the left
lung. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. The slightly
hyperexpanded right lung is unchanged.

CXR 2025-07-02
Unchanged slight hyperexpansion of the right lung. On the left,
the 2 chest tubes continue to be in good, unchanged position.
The air collection in the left lateral soft tissues is constant.
No visible pneumothorax. Normal size of the cardiac
silhouette.

CXR 2025-07-02 (CT to waterseal)
As compared to the previous examination, the 2 left-sided chest
tubes are in unchanged position. There still is no convincing
evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. No other
parenchymal changes are noted. Unchanged extension of air in the
left lateral soft tissues.

CXR 2025-07-02
As compared to 2025-08-14 radiograph, chest tubes remain
in place in the left hemi thorax, with a small left apical
pneumothorax now visible as well as a possible small basilar
pneumothorax component. Exam is otherwise unchanged.

CXR 2025-07-02 (s/p removal of one chest tube)
1 of the 2 left chest tubes has been discontinued. There is no
interval development of pneumothorax. Subcutaneous air within
the left chest wall is similar of minimally decreased as
compared to the prior study. Lungs are essentially clear.

CXR 2025-07-02
As compared to the previous examination, the chest tube on the
left is now attempt. There is a 3-4 mm left apical pneumothorax
without evidence of tension. The position of the chest tube is
unchanged. No other relevant changes as compared to the
previous image.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Ritter is a 1982 who had a previous right-sided spontaneous
pneumothoraces requiring lobectomy and pleurodesis who presented
with a left-sided spontaneous pneumothorax with chest tube
placement at OSJohns Hopkins Clinic prior to transfer to Guyâs and St. Thomasâ Hospital. A CTA chest was
done showing emphysematous changes and resolution of
pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement. He was admitted to the
Thoracic Surgery service on 2025-06-24 from the ED for further
management. On 2025-02-23, he was taken to the OR and underwent
VATS left upper lobe blebectomy with mechanical and chemical (1
g doxycycline) pleurodesis. He tolerated the procedure well; two
28 Fr chest tube drains were placed at the conclusion of the case that were
placed to suction. Post-op CXR showed expected changes.
Overnight, the patient required a short course of phenylephrine
drip for hypotension but easily weaned off by the next morning.
He also became agitated requiring Haldol.

The patient had a significant air leak post-operatively,
initially continuous then intermittent by POD2. Daily CXRs
showed no pneumothorax and stable appearance of the lungs. His
chest tubes remained to suction until 2025-01-21 when they were
placed on water seal. CXR remained unchanged w/o pneumothorax.
He continued to have an intermittent air leak. Given his stable
CXRs, his anterior (lower output) chest tube was removed on
2025-04-08 without interval development of pneumothorax on CXR.
Though his air leak improved, it was decided he would be
discharged with the remaining chest tube to ensure success of
the pleurodesis, and given that CXR on 2025-07-02 showed a tiny
left apical pneumothorax. The pleuravacs were exchanged for
pneumostats prior to discharge.

During his hospital course, the patient had little pain and
required no opioid analgesia. He tolerated a regular diet and
was ambulatory. He was afebrile and had a mild leukocytosis that
improved. He was able to wean off of supplementary O2. There was
some serosanguinous drainage from his chest tube sites that
slowed down by the time of discharge.

He was discharged home on 2025-05-02 with Home Physical Therapy services to help
manage his pneumostats. Immediately before discharge, the
patient voiced a new complaint of bilateral feet swelling and
reported that this happened during his previous hospitalization
as well and that he was discharged home on a short course of
Lasix. He had no other symptoms related to fluid overload or
DVT. The patient was reassured and instructed to wear
compression stockings, keep his legs elevated when not
ambulating, and to follow up with his PCP for further
management. He will follow up in the Thoracic Clinic in 1 week
with repeat CXR.

You were admitted to Guyâs and St. Thomasâ Hospital with a left pneumothorax that
required lung surgery for repair. You've recovered well and are
now ready for discharge. You will be going home with a chest
tube and visiting nurses 2012 help with your care. Please read
and adhere to the following instructions on discharge.

* Continue to use your incentive spirometer 10 times an hour
while awake.
* You will still need one of your chest tubes to remain in place
until your lung heals and the tubes are hooked up to a one way
valve called a pneumostat. The 2012 will help you manage these.
Check the site daily and notify Dr. Palmer. if there is any increased
redness or drainage at the site. The 2012 will review draining
the fluid from the pneumostat collection chamber.

* Your oxygen saturations were monitored and you will need some
oxygen at home at 2LPM to keep your sats > 91%. Use it at 2LPM
continuous. You should be able to wean it off once you heal up
from the surgery.
* Check your incisions daily and report any increased redness or
drainage. Cover the area with a gauze pad if it is draining.
* You will continue to need pain medication once you are home
but you can wean it over a few weeks as the discomfort resolves.
Make sure that you have regular bowel movements while on
narcotic pain medications as they are constipating which can
cause more problems. Use a stool softener or gentle laxative to
stay regular.
* No driving while taking narcotic pain medication.
* Take Tylenol 2003 mg every 6 hours in between your narcotic.
* Continue to stay well hydrated and eat well to heal your
incisions
* Shower daily. Wash incision with mild soap & water, rinse, pat
dry
* No tub bathing, swimming or hot tubs until incision healed
* No lotions or creams to incision site
* Walk 8 times a day and gradually increase your activity as
you can tolerate.

Call Dr. John Palmer if you experience:
-Fevers > 101 or chills
-Increased shortness of breath, chest pain or any other symptoms
that concern you.

IMAGING:
===================
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST 2025-08-10:
1. No fracture or malalignment.
2. Moderate multilevel cervical spine degenerative change, as
above.

CT TORSO W/CONTRAST 2025-02-18:
1. Mild soft tissue contusion along the left hip. Otherwise, no
acute sequelae of trauma.
2. Chronic extensive airways inflammation, detailed above,
likely
reflecting progressive atypical mycobacterial infection,
slightly
improved from prior CT.
3. Small locular gas within the urinary bladder, correlate for
recent instrumentation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 2025-03-25:
1. Bifrontal and right temporal lobe hemorrhagic contusion.
Small left cerebral subdural hematoma. No herniation or shift
of
midline structures.
2. Left frontal and periorbital soft tissue swelling/hematoma.
3. No fracture.

WRIST(3 + VIEWS) LEFT 2025-02-26:
Impacted, intra articular fracture involving the distal radius.
Ulnar styloid fracture Significant soft tissue swelling.
Chondrocalcinosis.

TTE (2025-06-04):
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10 mmHg mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%). There is
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-01-20,
biventricular function appears less vigorous; moderate pulmonary
hypertension is seen.

CXR (2025-08-06):
In comparison with the study of 2025-05-23, the cardiac
silhouette remains within normal limits. There is increased
engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels, consistent with the
clinical concern for developing pulmonary edema. Otherwise,
little change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neurosurgical course

On 2025-05-31, the patient was admitted from the ED at 08:42 PM for
bifrontal contusions and left SDH after being found down at her
nursing home. The patient was admitted to the neurosurgical ICU
for close monitoring and conservative management of her
intracranial bleeds.

On 2025-04-05 the patient was neurologically stable and was alert and
oriented to person only which was consistent with her baseline
dementia. The patient was moving all of her extremities
antigravity to command, and her left upper extremity was
splinted secondary to a wrist fracture. The patient moved her
lower extremities anti gravity to command. The patient was
hypotensive despite being on maintenance fluids of NS at 70
ml/hr, had decreased urine output and continued on ceftriaxone
for a UTI. The patient was afebrile with a TMAX of 99.

On 2025-04-05 the patient remained neurologically stable. She was
transferred to the MICU service for optimization of medial
management as she has a history of CKD and has been hypotensive,
with low urine outputs, and requiring fluid boluses in addition
to continuous intravenous fluids.

**MICU COURSE/Floor Course**
2025-03-15 with hx of Afib, depression/anxiety who is s/p fall w/ mild
TBI w/ b/l hemorrhagic contusions and small left subdural w/o
mass effect with left distal radius fracture in the setting of
UTI, initially hypotensive in MICU, however called with floor
course c/b delirium.

#acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Most likely in setting of
UTI and in setting of pain from fall. After calling outpatient
SNF, A&O x 3 at baseline, howevere here, continued to be A&O x 2
(name, location, not date). No focal neurologic deficits to
invoke cerebral edema. She was treated for UTI as below with
pain control with standing Tylenol.

#uncomplicated E. coli UTI: Patient with grossly positive U/A,
now with no further complaints of dysuria or urinary frequency.
E. coli sensitive to CTX, for which she completed a 3-day
course. Foley was discontinued.

#SDH, TBI w/ bilateral hemorrhagic contusions: 2025-02-13 fall. No
evidence of cerebral edema, no N/V. Anticoagulation held per
neurosurgery and was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis x
7-days (last day 2025-01-11). She has plans to follow-up with
neurosurgery as outpatient with repeat CT head.

#L distal radius fracture: 2025-02-13 fall. Her fracture was splinted
by hand surgery with plans to follow-up with them as outpatient.

# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS-Vasc = 4. Currently not on
anticoagulation given falls and subdural hemorrhage. Propranolol
was initially held in setting of hypotension in the MICU and was
restarted with appropriate rate control.

#Fall: Fall and syncope of unclear etiology. however, given hx
of LH on standing and hypotensive episodes in TSICU as below,
concerning for overmedication with BBL (admitted on propranolol
20 tid). Also, her impaired mobility requiring a walker and 1
person assist and tendency to attempt ADL/IADL without these
supports likely contributed. Finally, sensory impairments of ?
trying to ambulate to the restroom at nighttime, when lighting
may have been inadequate and she may or may not have had her
usual sensory aids (glasses etc) may have contributed. Fall
precautions were placed and patient remained fall-free. Received
TdaP vaccine on 2025-03-06 prior to discharge.

Transitional Issues:
mediastinal LN seen on Chest CT; will need f/u
anemia work-up as outpatient
will need repeat head CT prior to f/u with neurosurgery
(scheduled at Continue wound care with daily dressing changes as instructed. already)

2025-05-20 TTE:
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal IVC diameter (<=2.1cm)
with >50% decrease with sniff (estimated RA pressure 10 mmHg mmHg).


LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Present resting LVOT gradient. Present VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). Present AS. Present AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. Present MS.

Melinda Ayala VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Present PS.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Present echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Present contrast related complications. Suboptimal
image quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal image quality -
body habitus.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10 mmHg mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is Present ventricular septal defect.
RV with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and Present aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There are Present echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
2006 F with asthma, COPD on home O2 presenting with progressive
cough, SOB, and increased O2 requirement.
.
# Acute COPD exacerbation
# Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure
# Morbid obesity, potentially with component of obesity
hypoventilation syndrome
Given two weeks of progressive symptoms and increased O2 use,
appears to be acute COPD exacerbation likely triggered by viral
URI. CXR not convincing for PNA, but read as possible RLL
infiltrate. PE thought to be unlikely given subacute onset and
preceding URI symptoms. Improved with treatment as COPD
exacerbation with standing nebs, PRN nebs, and IV-then-PO
steroids as well as for possible atypical PNA (initially with
levofloxacin, 1 dose in ED, then doxycycline). Avoided
quinolones after admission given history of mood disorder and
age. Discharged with plan to continue standing duonebs TID x2
days, then transition to PRN nebs, then to PRN inhalers.
Discharged on steroid taper
(60,50,50,40,40,30,30,20,20,10,10,stop). Last day would be
2025-05-22. Discharged on doxycycline to complete 7 day course
for possible atypical PNA given her overall improvement during
hospitalization. Close PCP Jennifer Murphy apt scheduled. Paged Dr. Melanie Murray,
City Clinic pulmonologist on day of discharge to provide clinical
update and discuss discharge planning, but we were not able to
get in touch prior to discharge. Pulmonary clinic appointment
is pending (Care Connection team will call patient with
appointment). Think she would benefit from consideration of
pulmonary rehab given her recurrent COPD exacerbation and
significant chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
# Markport edema
Had recently been on Lasix 2025-01-25, last echo was from 2025-04-23. Present
evidence of vol overload on exam or CXR aside from 1+ Markport edema
that she reports is basically unchanged from her baseline,
though got Lasix in the ED. ProBNP of 534 was equivocal,
particularly in the setting of morbid obesity, so we obtained
TTE to eval for CHF, pulm HTN. TTE showed normal LVEF and Present
compelling evidence of pulmonary hypertension or LV diastolic
dysfunction (though limited by body habitus, TV was not
visualized). Her leg edema remained stable throughout her
hospitalization without any treatment with Lasix.
.
# Positive UA
She reported malodorous urine recently, now resolved. Initial
UA was positive with 3+ leuk esterase, 29 WBCs, only 1 epi, but
UCx grew mixed bacterial flora. She had received 1 dose
levofloxacin in ED and on doxy as above, but we elected not to
treat specifically for UTI given absence of predominant
infecting organism on UCx and resolution of symptoms.
.
# OSA on home CPAP
- CPAP at nigh while hospitalized
.
# Mood/insomnia
History of depression with suicidality. Currently stable.
- continued doxepin, though there was some uncertainty to her
home dose of doxepin, she thought she was taking 250 mg daily,
but per discussion with her pharmacy, she last filled an Rx for
150 mg tabs (she takes 2) and 25 mg tabs (she takes one) for a
potential home dose of 325 mg. We left a message with her
psychiatrist. We advised the patient to clarify with her
psychiatrist the intended dosing of this medication.
- contined home clonazepam
- continued home risperidone

Discharge Instructions:
Ms Dunn,

You were admitted to the hospital with worsening shortness of
breath at rest and with exertion. This was thought to be most
likely due to an exacerbation of your COPD, possible caused by a
recent viral or bacterial respiratory infection. You were
treated with steroids, frequent nebulizers, and oral antibiotics
with improvement in your symptoms.

As we discussed, it is very important that you use oxygen when
you exert yourself, such as anytime you are walking, including
trips to the bathroom. This will help you feel less short of
breath with walking, as well as to walk longer distances before
having to stop to catch your breath.

Please complete the remaining course of antibiotics
(doxycycline), the last dose will be on 2025-05-22.

Please complete the remaining course of steroids (prednisone).
You are starting a taper. Tomorrow you will take 60 mg, then 50
mg each day for 2 days, then 40 mg each day for 2 days, and so
on until you complete prednisone. Your last dose of prednisone
is scheduled for 2025-05-22.

Please see your primary care physician, Jennifer Murphy, at the
appointment scheduled (see below).

Please see your pulmonologist (lung doctor), Dr. Melanie Murray 26 days to follow-up on this hospitalization for exacerbation
of your COPD and to evaluate your recovery on the prednisone
taper.

It was a pleasure caring for you while you were in the hospital
and we wish you a full and speedy recovery.

Sincerely,
The General City Hospital Medicine Team

MICROBIOLOGY:
==============================
2025-08-17 ALL BLOOD CULTURES - NO GROWTH

IMAGING:
==============================
2025-06-21 HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST, FINDINGS:
The predominantly frontal lobe periventricular lucency is again
noted unchanged from 2 days ago. The hydrocephalus is unchanged.
The right sided subcortical white matter low density area
probably representing ischemic change is unchanged. No new
lesions are seen. There is no mass effect or midline shift.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. There is no
evidence of acute stroke. Bone windows reveal a burr hole in the
right frontal bone. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
Vascular calcification is again noted. No change from the
previous study.

2025-06-21 ECHO, FINDINGS:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 61
%). The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?). No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
regional and global biventricular systolic function.

2025-06-21 XR LEFT HEEL IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate thickening of the Achilles tendon with prominent
superimposed heterotopic calcification can be seen with
tendinosis or sequelae of prior trauma.
2. There is no evidence of frank bone destruction or
radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis. However please note
that radiographs are not sensitive for detection of early
osteomyelitis and MRI should be considered if there is high
clinical suspicion.

2025-06-21 XR PELVIS IMPRESSION:
Multilevel degenerative changes. Suboptimal evaluation for
osteomyelitis.

2025-06-21 RENAL US IMPRESSION:
Normal renal ultrasound. Specifically, no fluid collection is
identified.

2025-06-21 CT HEAD IMPRESSION:
1. Increased hypodensity in the right frontal lobe at the site
of biopsy
proven lymphoma may represent an increase in vasogenic edema or
progression of disease.
2. Cortical hyperdensity at the parafalcine frontal lobes is
minimally more conspicuous than on priors. While this is likely
due to volume averaging, petechial hemorrhage cannot be entirely
excluded.
3. MRI is recommended for further evaluation.

2025-08-12 TUNNELED CENTRAL LINE PLACEMENT IMPRESSION:
Successful placement of a Hickman catheter tunneled line via the right
internal jugular venous approach. The tip of the catheter
terminates in the right atrium. The catheter is ready for use.

2025-06-21 Imaging CTA CHEST
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality.
2. Within limitations of motion artifact, diffuse septal
thickening and
ground-glass opacities likely represents pulmonary edema.
However atypical infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate
clinical setting.

2025-06-21 Imaging BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

IMPRESSION:

Somewhat limited assessment of the posterior tibial peroneal
veins in the
bilateral lower extremities, but otherwise, no evidence of deep
venous
thrombosis in the right or left lower extremity veins.

2025-06-21BD & PELVIS W/O CON
IMPRESSION:

1. Pneumatosis of the ascending colon and hepatic flexure is new
as compared to CT abdomen pelvis 2025-06-02. Clinical
correlation and a lactate level is recommended.
2. Sacral decubital ulcer with stranding of the soft tissues
deep to the ulcer is within normal limits given recent
debridement. There is no evidence of a fluid collection.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

2025-06-21 Imaging CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:

1. Right frontal hypodensity, previously characterized as
vasogenic edema is unchanged as compared to CT head 2025-06-02 and compatible with the area of patient's biopsy proven CNS
lymphoma. No evidence of worsening edema.
2. No acute intrathoracic abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. Richards is a 1975 year old y/o female with hypothyroidism,
DMII, and recent diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma c/b CVA
leaving her with minimally responsive and chronic g tube/foley
as well as pseudomonal CAUTI (s/p cipro 2025-05-04). She
presented initially CHA ED from her rehab facility with fever,
rigors and suprapubic tenderness consistent with UTI with MRSA
bacteremia and found to
have new hydrocephalus, transferred to Max Super Speciality Hospital for further
management, with course c/b hyponatremia thought Respiratory Failure SIADH and
persistent sacral ulcer now s/p diverting colostomy 2025-08-11.

# Unstageable sacral ulcer: S/p OR debridement 2025-08-11. S/p
diverting colostomy and further debridement of her sacral wound
on 2025-08-11 so as to improve wound healing. Patient underwent
aggressive wound care by nursing. A wound vac was placed by the
wound care team and healthy granulation tissue started to appear
on the wound. Some irritation was noted prior to discharge and
the patient was given a break from the wound vac. Wound care has
been in contact with her rehab facility to plan transfer of
wound care once discharged.

# MRSA Bacteremia: Most likely sources include bladder vs.
ulcers/osteomyelitis (however not seen on XRays of the
heel/pelvis - but can be assumed that has in the pelvis). A
temporary tunneled line was placed for access on 2025-08-11. She was
started on Daptomycin 8mg/kg q24h and Ceftaroline 600mg q12h
with plans to finish her antibiotics on 2025-07-09. On 2025-07-09, the
patient was noted to have fevers and be hypoxic. Her CXR showed
volume overload which improved with diuresis. Given the fevers,
ID was reconsulted who said that the patient's fevers were
likely due to drug fevers from the patient's ceftaroline as she
had previously experienced a rash while on this medicine. The
ceftaroline was discontinued and she was started on daptomycin
which was then switched to linezolid for better pulmonary
coverage. The patient underwent a CTA to rule out PE as a
non-infectious cause of fevers. This was negative. In addition,
the patient underwent a CT Abd/Pelvis to assess for a wound
infection given her recent surgery. This demonstrated
pneumotosis in her colon. A lactate was obtained which was
normal. Her vital signs and physical exam were unchanged.
Although her Lactate has risen to 4, given her clinical
stability, a surgical consulted recommended no intervention. The
patient then received 1u of pRBC for a borderline Hgb which
improved her lactate. She remained afebrile and hemodynacmially
stable on Meropenem/Linezolid which she completed on 2025-07-09.

# Hydrocephalus in the context of CNS Lymphoma: Last MRI brain
on 2025-06-21 showed improved mass size, no mass effect, and no
hydrocephalus. Found to have new hydrocephalus on CT at 2025-06-21 and the patient was transferred to Max Super Speciality Hospital.
Started on decadron prior
to transfer. She was found to be less responsive on 2025-07-09. Repeat
NC Head CT (2025-06-21) without increase in hydrocephalus. Her mental
status was waxing and waning, but generally improved throughout
her stay. She was continued on 1 mg IV dexamethasone daily along
with valproic acid. The valproic acid was discontinued on 2025-07-09
to see if this would improve her mental status and she had not
demonstrated seizure activity. There was no change in the
patient's clinical status upon discontinuation. In addition, her
dexamethasone was decreased to 0.5mg daily. She was converted to
prednisone 3mg daily which was discontinued on 2025-07-09.

# Hyponatermia: Renal consulted, thought to represent SIADH and
as such fluid restricted and limited free water intake. Her
sodium began to improve on 2025-07-09 and has remained stable.

# Diarrhea: C. Diff and Norovirus negative. Gave Loperamide and
Lomotil PRN, and wound management subsequently improved with
colostomy.

# Normocytic anemia: with Hgb 6.6, MCV 9.4 Hgb was wnl 2025-07-09
but appears to have been slowly downtrending--as low as 6.8 in
early 2025-07-09 with FOBT positive 2025-07-09. Iron 13, TIBC 158
(transferrin saturation 8.2%) suggesting severe iron deficiency,
so the patient was given a dose of IV iron.

# History of DVT: Was on lovenox 2025-01-18 (stopped d/t
thrombocytopenia). Very high risk DVT--prior provoked UE DVT,
recent ischemic stroke. As such, was continued on Heparin 5000 units SC q8h.
Given her
decreased mobility, she was discharged on Lovenox 40 mg SC daily

# Poor nutritional status. Patient was maintained on tube feeds
through NG tube tube.

# DMII: Hyperglycemic in the setting of high dose decadron.
Continued home NPH 8 units BID. Will need to have blood sugars
monitored at rehab given decreasing steroid needs with plans to
lower insulin requirements.

# Hypothyroidism: T4 level wnl, TSH wnl. Continued home
levothyroxine.

# Hyperkalemia: In the setting of TFs, transitioned to Nepro
formulation with subsequent resolution of hyperkalemia.

# Rash: Developed a rash on 2025-07-09 after the infusion of
Ceftaroline. ID was re-consulted and said given that lack of
pulmonary or systemic symptoms, that she should continue with
her ceftaroline infusions. She was started on fexofenadine with
improvement of her symptoms.

#Goals of Care: Multiple family meetings were held during the 2025-06-29
hospital stay. It was determined that our plan would
be to get the patient strong enough to receive chemotherapy
defined as 1. Improved functional status while working with
physical therapy. 2. Improvement of Sacral Ulcer. We also
discussed that we would avoid unnecessary/invasive testing and
procedures as these would be unlikely to change her management.
Therefore, the patient's code status was changed to DNR/DNI. The
family was willing to entertain CMO status if the patient were
to decompensate clinically.

Dear Steven Richards,

Jeanne Smith were transferred from Hematology-Oncology after Jeanne Smith
were found to have a bloodstream infection, possibly from your
ulcer on your back. We did a debridement of your ulcer and
treated your infection with antibiotics and your mental status
improved--we also did a colostomy to prevent your wound from
getting worse. Jeanne Smith and your family discussed options going
forward with Dr. Mark Miller. Jeanne Smith had a line placed to give Jeanne Smith
antibiotics which will continue until 2025-07-09. Currently
chemotherapy is not an option until Sudden Cardiac Arrest improve.

Please keep your appointments and take your medications as

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. Thompson is a 1973 y/o M with PMH notable for glaucoma,
gout, and intermittent lower GI bleeding who presents from HCA
to the ED today with several weeks of blood in his stools. The
patient states that he has had bright and dark blood in his
stools for several weeks. This problem happens every few months
per his report. He has had intermittent dizziness in the past
few days. He denies any chest pain or difficulty breathing. His
wife convinced him to come in for evaluation today. At 01:52 PM, the patient's BP was 88/39 lying down and 79/40 standing. An
ambulance was called and he was brought to the Massachusetts General Hospital ED.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient's initial vitals were T 97.5,
HR 84, BP 93/55, RR 18. His Hct was found to be 21.1 (last in
our system 28.5). Blood pressures ranged from 141/71 mmHg systolic
in the ED. He receieved a total of 3 L NS and 1 U PRBCs. The Unit B456 unit of blood was hanging on his arrival to the ICU. He also
underwent CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis due to intermittent
abdominal pain and cramping over the past few weeks; he did not
have any evidence of mesenteric ischemia. On rectal exam, the
patient was actually guaiac negative without any stool in the
vault. No obvious hemorrhoidal bleeding.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient denies any dizziness, chest
pain, difficulty breathing, or abdominal pain. He last noticed
bright and dark blood in his stools several days ago. He says
that he has had abdominal cramping ""off and on"" and has been
intermittently dizzy for several days. He denies any
nausea/vomiting or hematemesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 1973 y/o man with PMH of recurrent GI bleeding admitted
with bright and dark blood in the stool for several weeks and
hct 21.1.
.
# GI bleeding: Patient has had multiple episodes of lower GI
bleeding in the past. His current episode is likely secondary to
hemorrhoids versus diverticulosis. He did not have any
nausea/vomiting or hematemesis to suggest upper GI source though
this is technically a possibility. He was subsequently placed on
a PPI IV bid initially. There were no signs of mesenteric
ischemia on CT scan, though diverticulosis was noted.
    Pt was admitted initially to the MICU for management of his
lower GI bleed. He received a total of 3 units and 2L of IV
fluids. His crit bumped from 21.1 to 28 after 3 units. He was
transferred to the floor the next day. He was guiaic negative on
admission, but did eventually pass at least 2 soft stools with
grossly bright red blood. His crits were followed bid, and
remained stable. He was seen by GI, who did not think further
endoscopy would be useful for hemorrhoid/diverticular bleed, and
deferred evaluation to General Surgery for possible surgical
intervention, e.g. hemorrhoidectomy. Pt is seen by Dr. Michael Martinez in
Colorectal Satellite clinic. Given pt's long history of hemorrhoidal
bleeds with banding, and pt's risk factors at age 1973, Surgery
did not think pt would benefit from hemorrhoidectomy at this
time. Pt continued to be hemodynamically stable on day of
discharge. He will be seeing his PCP, Tiffany Harris for
repeat crit check, and will be following up with Dr. Michael Martinez in
Colorectal Satellite clinic in the beginning of Aug 2022. He was
instructed to call his PCP or go to the ED if bleeds return or
worsen. Pt was discharged on high fiber diet and fiber
supplementation to improve bulking of the stools. Fiber
supplementation should be uptitrated to~30mg/day.
.
# EKG changes: Patient has had no complaints of chest pain but
had TWI on EKG done in ED. This likely represents sequelae of
anemia and demand ischemia given Hct of 21.1. Repeat EKG the
next a.m. showed resolution of TWI, just flattened T waves in
the lateral V leads. Cardiac enzymes were negative x3. Pt had no
additional cardiac symptoms during admission.
.
# Leukopenia: Per OMR, this is a chronic condition for pt. 4 ct was 2.8 on admission. WBC ct stabilized at 4.5 on day of
discharge. Pt continued to remain afebrile.
.
# Glaucoma: Pt was continued on his home Timolol and Brimonidine
eye drops.
.
# h/o gout: Stable.l Pt did not have any symptoms of gout flare,
and was continued on home Allopurinol.
.
#pruritis: Pt complained of some mild itching on back. There
weere no lesions or rashes visible. He was treated with Sarna
lotion, with improvement.
.
# FEN: Regular cardiac diet, replete lytes prn
.
# PPx: pneumoboots, bowel regimen
.
# Access: 16 g PIV and 18 g PIV

Discharge Diagnosis:
Lower GI bleed

Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, hematocrit stable (29.2), afebrile

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for management of lower GI bleeding. This was
most likely related to your hemorrhohids. You were lightheaded
and had a very low blood level. Therefore, you received IV
fluids and 3 units of blood. You were seen by GI and Colorectal
Surgery, and they did not feel that surgery was necessary at
this time. You will be following up as an outpatient with Dr.
Michael Martinez in Colorectal Satellite clinic. Please see your PCP, Tiffany Victoria Williams Harris for follow-up of you blood levels.
.
If you experience any return of profuse bleeding,
lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, or have any other
concerns please call your MD or return to the ED.
.
Please continue your medications as prescribed.
- We added Psyllium as a new fiber supplement to your daily
diet. This can be bought over the counter (e.g. Metamucil.) This
should help to keep your stools soft and reduce your tendency to
bleed from straining when constipated.

Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Robert Hudson cooling protocol

History of Present Illness:
This is a 1997 year old female with a PMH significant for
diabetes, HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, who presents status cardiac
arrest at her nursing home. Per family report, patient was seen
choking by family and quickly beceame unresponsive. Nursing
staff called EMS, who found the patient sitting upright in a
chair, cyanotic, and pulseless. CPR was initiated at 1:30 07:20 PM
and patient received 1mg IV epinephrine and 1mg IV atropine with
return of pulses. Patient was noted to have tonic/clonic
jerking and was intubated en route to National University Hospital.
.
At National University Hospital, patient underwent head CT which was
indeterminate and chest radiograph was with report of aspiration
pneumonia. Patient was given 500 cc NS bolus. Patient was
transferred to National University Hospital to further evaluate possible subarachnoid
hemorrhage.
.
At the National University Hospital ED, initial vital signs were: 98.8, 78, 121/99, 24,
96% on AC FiO2 100%, 450, 14, Peep 5. Patient was initially not
on any sedation and was withdrawing to pain with pupils 5-6 mm
bilaterally and sluggish. Labs notable for a leukocytosis of
16.2, 5 bands, ALT: 304, AST: 272, Trop: 0.12, MB 7, lactate of
2.1. Repeat head CT without acute bleed. Chest radiograph with
no acute process. CTA was without PE but with bilateral
multifocal pneumonia. Patient was given vancomycin 1gram IV,
500 mg IV flagyl, and ceftriaxone 1g IV X 1. Post-cardiac
arrest team was consulted and hypothermia protocol was
initiated. Vecuronium 10mg IV X 1 was given due to shivering.

Bilateral multifocal consolidations worse in the lung bases
representing

catheter was
presumably removed.

CT HEAD:
Wet Read: AS of WED 05 8:18 07:28 AM
Motion degrades study. No intracranial hemorrhage. If the
outside hospital
report was definitive, please provide location. No other acute
intracranial
process.

EKG: Sinus rhythm with rate of 107, normal axis and normal
intervals. No ST or T wave changes concerning for ischemia. No
old ECG for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Cardiac arrest: based on history most likely etiology was
aspiration event resulting in likely PEA arrest. Evidence of
bilateral multifocal pneumonia on CTA is consistent with this
possibility. Patient without evidence of cardiac ischemia by
ECG or cardiac biomarkers. CPR initiated in the field with
return of pulses. Reportedly, in the emergency room a family
member said the patient was full code. Therefore, hypothermia
protocol was initiated in the ED, and patient remained
intubated. In the morning, the patient's power of attorney (Mr.
Jennifer Carpenter called to report patient was DNr/DNI. The paperwork
making him POA were faxed to the MICU. Mr. Jennifer Carpenter was spoken to
over the phone (he resides out of state) and confirmed the
patient was DNR/DNI prior to her arrest. The patient was thus
rewarmed using the re-warming protocol. according to the
patient's prior wishes she was extubated and died at 5:24pm. The
family declined autopsy but the medical examiner accepted the
case. The NEOB was contacted but did not deem her a candidate
for organ donation.

IMPRESSION: Appearance is similar to prior study with mild basal
atelectasis on the left and small right effusion in addition to
mild increased interstitial markings peripherally in the right
lung and at the left lower zone, which may reflect underlying
interstitial disease, possibly with mild superimposed edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Rodriguez was taken to the operating room by Dr. Haley Gill on
2025-06-18 for right thoractomy and tracheoplasty with mesh, right
main stem bronchus/bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh,
left main stem bronchus bronchoplasty with mesh, and
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, for her
tracheobronchomalacia. The patient was extubated in the OR, and
transfered to the PACU for recovery then to the SICU for further
management that evening. The patient had epidural with
bupivicaine and dilaudid for pain management. The patient was
transferred to the floor in stable condition on 2025-06-08 (POD 2).
The following is a systems review of her hospital course.

Neurologic: The patient had a bupivicaine and dilaudid PCA which
was effective in pain control. Acute pain service managed this
until it was discontinued on POD 3. The patient was transitioned
to tylenol, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and lidocaine which was
effective. She is also on home gabapentin. She remained
neurologically intact. Of note she admits to former narcotic
addiction, therefore care will be made to assist in titrating
off oxycodone after the immediate postoperative period.

Pulmonary: The patient was brought out of the OR with a right
28 Fr chest tube which was removed on POD 1 without pneumothorax
on postpull film. Aggressive pulmonary toilet was instituted
with around the clock mucolytics, nebulizers, and incentive
spirometry. The patient was kept on her home inhalers, and home
bipap. She also remained on oxygen via nasal canula 4L during
the day. At night she used her home bipap. Pulmonary was
consulted and followed alongside. The patient had desaturations
during the night on bipap therefore her nightly oxygen was
increased to >92% with 6L. Two doses of lasix were given POD 3
and 4 for pulmonary congestion and to diurese after the initial
fluid given postoperatively. CXR's were followed.

CV: The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout her
stay in NSR.

Abd: The patient was advanced to a regular diet which she
tolerated. Stool softeners were given. The patient passed gas
and was close to having a bowel movement on date of discharge.

GU: A foley was kept during the epidural and dc'd POD 3 with
good urinary response thereafter.

ID: The patient remained afebrile with CBC trends followed.
There were no infectious processes during the stay.

Prophylaxis: Heparin was given for DVT prophylaxis.

Dispo: Hepatology evaluated the patient on POD 4 and deemed the patient
would benefit from a short stay in rehab, which the patient
would also like.

The patient was ambulating with Walker, tolerating a regular diet
with pain controlled on an oral regimine. Her oxygen on 4L nasal
cannula was 95%. The patient was deemed stable for transfer to
rehab on 2025-05-20.

Pertinent Results:
2025-03-29 Echo: Pre-pericardial stripping: A patent foramen ovale
is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is a moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is no evidence of pericardial constriction (abnormal
septal motion, LV inflow pattern abnormalities), however tissue
Doppler and Vp suggest (borderline) abnormal diastolic function.
Post effusion drainage/pericardial stripping showed a change of
E:A ratios from near 2:1 toward 1:1. No other changes were
observed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Weber was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On 2025-07-27 she was brought directly to
the Operating Room where she underwent pericardial stripping.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery she was transferred to the Jasminefort for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from
sedation and extubated.

She does have a psychiatric history including bi-polar disease.
She experienced post-operative delerium. Narcotics and
benzodiazepines were minimized. Psychiatry was consulted and
her mental status cleared. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward her preoperative weight. The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.

The patient was noted to have a lower extremity tremor.
Neurology was consulted. The tremor did resolve prior to
discharge. Neurology recommended an MRI for evaluation,
however, the patient was unable to tolerate this. It will be
scheduled as an outpatient, and the patient will follow up with
neurology following discharge.

Chest tubes were discontinued without complication. The patient
was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on 2025-05-22
the patient was ambulating without assistance, the wound was
healing Granulation tissue present pain was controlled with oral analgesics.

Rheumatology was consulted for evaluation of a possible auto
immine etiology of the pericarditits and ANA and rheumatoid
factor assays were sent. Arrangements were made for outpatient
follow up with them at the time of her return surgical visit.
The patient was discharged to home in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mary Dickson w/hx of DM, atrial flutter, CAD s/p CABG, chronic renal
failure, diastoic CHF who p/w weakness found to have orthostasis
and Community-acquired pneumonia.

# Hypotension: Patient with SBP in 140/80 mmHg upon standing while in
ED, baseline in 110s. Orthostasis and hypotension most likely
secondary to aggressive diuresis in setting of recent CHF
exacerbation. Pt improved with hydration and cardiac enzymes
were negative x3. His anti-hypertensive meds (imdur,
metoprolol,lisinopril) were held on admission and were gradually
added back as patient's bp stabilized. His lasix dose was scaled
back to 100mg BID. Pt's BPs remained in low 100s throughout
first day of admission and he was net negative 2L. Decision was
made to scale back his lasix dose to 100mg daily. His BP
improved and patient states he felt the best he as in a while.
At discharge, continues to have a SBP in the 105-115 range but
is clinically greatly improved. Furthermore, he shows no
worsening signs of fluid overload and there are minimal rales on
chest ausculatation. He will follow up with with his primary
cardiologist as an outpatient for better titration of lasix
doses.

# Generalized weakness: Most likely secondary to intravascular
depletion secondary to aggressive diuresis. Orthostasis and
elevated cr further support this diagnosis. Pt says he is
greatly improved following several boluses. He had no signs of
infection (no WBC, fever, cough) or CP/SOB to suggest other
etiologies. His lasix dose was decreased to 100mg daily at
discharge. He has no signs of fluid overload and will follow up
with cardiologist regarding redosing of medications.

# Acute kidney injury: creatinine up to 2.3 from baseline 1.6,
with a peak of 3 followind admission. Differential included
prerenal causes (volume depletion or possibly due to
decompensated CHF) and acute tubular necrosis. BUN/Cr ratio is
>20 suggested volume depletion and his cr improved with IV
fluids. His lisinopril was held but restarted when he renal
function improved at discharge. His allopurinol was renally
dosed.

# Diastolic congestive heart failure: patient with improved leg
edema but normal BNP and signs suggesting volume depletion.
Lasix dose was reduced from pre-admission 320mg daily and pt was
closely monitored for signs of fluid overload. His weight
remained uncharged throughout admission. Metroprolol, imdur, and
lisinopril were

# Atrial flutter: heart rate currently controlled, INR
therapeutic at 2.6 at admission. Home warfarin and amiodarone
continued.

# Coronary artery disease s/p CABG. This did not appear to be a
cardiac event in setting of (-)trops, no EKG changes, or CP. He
was continued on ASA and statin and metoprolol, imdur, and ACEI
orginally held but added back throughout admission.

# Anemia, chronic: patient currently at baseline hematocrit,
continue to trend H/H as outpatient

#UTI:Patient was recently diagnosed with a UTI on previous
admission and completed a 7 day course of Cipro during this
admission. Pt denies dysuria or suprapubic pain.

# Diabetes mellitus: well controlled on ISS throughout admission

# Hypothyroidism : Stable, continued home levothyroxine
# Hyperlipidemia: continued home atorvastatin

Transitions of Care:
1.Pt will follow up with cardiology regarding dosing of lasix.
Pt will take 100mg of lasix daily following discharge. He is
instructed to return to ED if he experiences worsening SOB, CP,
or weight gain > 3 lbs.
2.Will follow up with his PCP regarding anemia and renal
function

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Dickson,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at Duke University Hospital.
You came in due to weakness and fatigue. These symptoms were
most likely secondary to a low blood sugar and low blood
pressure. In the ED, you were found to have a very low blood
pressure and you were given IV fluids. We held your blood
pressure medications and Lasix and your weakness and fatigue
improved. We slowly restarted your medications and you responded
well. You will continue a recently prescribed lower dose of
Lasix to help prevent low blood pressure.

Please continue to take your home medications as directed. NOTE,
on 2025-07-25 you should begin taking Amiodarone 200 mg twice
daily instead of 3 times daily.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 1975 yo M with history of hypertension, chronic systolic CHF
with EF 25%, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, status post ICD
placement in 2018, obesity, IDDM, charcot deformity of RLE s/p
reconstruction with multiple revisions presents with right lower
extremity cellulitis. About 6mo ago the patient had a revision
of his charcot's foot hardware. 3mo ago he developed cellulitis
and was on Vancomycin. His foot pain improved and he was able to
start walking. He stopped the vancomycin 4 weeks prior to
presentation. Two weeks prior to presenation his foot pain
resumed and he was unable to walk. He describes his pain as
5/10 (moderate) from his Right ankle to his right foot. He did not notices
any skin redness or had any fevers/chills. He saw his podiatrist
and was admitted on 2025-02-13 to the podiatry service for RLE
cellulitis and removal of his foot hardware. His operation was
delayed due to a high INR. He tolerated the procedure well and
currently has an external fixation device. His pain is currently
controlled with a Dilaudid PCA. He had one episode of
nausea/vomiting the night after his operation when he attempted
eating after arriving on the floor. Otherwise he denies current
fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nause/vomiting,

Radiology
2025-04-23 Right ankle/foot AP/Lateral/Oblique: Again noted is
fractured calcaneal screw with approximately 1-cm gap. There is
progressive fragmentation of the osseous structures of the
hindfoot consistent with known Charcot. Again noted are distal
fibulectomy changes. There is extensive periosteal reaction
about the heads of the screws protruding from the medial aspect
of the distal tibia. No effusion is identified at the tibiotalar
joint. There is solid osseous fusion at the posterior subtalar
joint.
.
2025-04-23 Chest Xray: A roughly 60 x 20 mm wide bulge of the left
lower lateral costal pleural margin lies against intact ribs and
was probably not present on 2025-01-06. As such, this is
probably a small pleural fluid collection. Pleural surfaces are
otherwise normal.
.
2025-04-23 Right ankle/foot AP/Lateral/Oblique: There has been
interval placement of a radiopaque external fixer device. There
has been interval placement of methyl methacrylate beads on the
wire within the tibiotalar joint. Osseous disorganization,
destruction, and debris, primarily of the hind and mid foot is
again present. Fixation rod along the first ray remains in
place. The subtalar arthrodesis rods have been removed. No
lucency is appreciated along the external fixator wires.

Brief Hospital Course:
1975 year old male with a history of hypertension, chronic
systolic CHF with EF 25%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, s/p
ICD placement in 2018, obesity, DM2, charcot deformity of RLE
p/w RLE cellulitis s/p hardware removal on 2025-05-23
.
1) Right foot revision: As stated, the patient was admitted to
the hospital on 2025-02-13 for right lower extremity cellulitis and
removal of his charcot foot hardware. His procedure was delayed
due to a high INR. The patient had the procedure on 2025-05-23, and
tolerated the procedure well and his external fixator is in
place. Tissue cultures were sent that showed white blood cells
but no growth. His cellulitis and possible osteomyelitis were
treated with Vancomycin, Flagyl, and Ciprofloxacin for a total
of 21 days. After the procedure his pain was controlled with a
Dilaudid PCA that was then transitioned to oral pain
medications. The patient's pain was controlled with Oxycontin
40mg po BID, Tylenol 1g TID, and Oxycodone Q4hr prn breakthrough
pain. He will follow up with podiatry within 3 weeks.
.
2) Chronic atrial fibrillation: The patient's coumadin was
stopped for the procedure. After the procedure he was bridged on
heparin and restarted on his coumadin. On the day of his
discharge his INR was 1.9 and he was given Lovenox. A home nurse
would come to his house and check his INR the day after his
discharge (2025-04-21) and send the results to his PCP. His PCP was
going to further manage his coumadin after discharge. He was
discharged on Coumadin 10mg by mouth every day.
.
3) Chronic systolic CHF with EF 25%: After the procedure he had
an increased creatinine (1.3). His Lisinopril was held and his
Tramadol was decreased. His Cr improved. He was discharged on
his home regimen of Tramadol and Lisinopril.
.
4) Hematuria: On 2025-03-08 the patient has an episode of hematuria
in the morning. There were no clots. The patient did not report
dysuria. This was mostly likely secondary to having a Foley and
a transiently elevated PTT that day. His hematocrit was stable
and his hematuria resolved prior to discharge.
.
5) IDDM: The patient's insulin regimen was adjust for elevated
blood glucose while in the hospital. He was discharged on
Glargine 75 units at breakfast and at bedtime. His sliding scale
of Humalog was also increased. His sliding scale was provided to
him on the day of his discharge. He was told to check his blood
sugars and follow up with his PCP.
.
6) Urinary tract infection: A urine culture was done on 2025-07-11
that grew E.coli bacteria. The bacteria was sensitive to
Ciprofloxacin that he was already using for osteomyelitis.
.
7) Anemia: Prior to his procedure his hemoglobin was 11.5. After
the procedure his hemoglobin was 10.6. His Hg was 9.2 on
discharge, but it had remained stable for several days. He was
guiac negative.
.
6) Abnormal chest x-ray: A pre-operation AP/Lateral chest x-ray
was done on 2025-08-02. It showed ""a roughly 60 x 20 mm wide bulge
of the left lower lateral costal pleural margin lies against
intact ribs and was probably not present on 2025-05-21. As
such, this is probably a small pleural fluid collection. Pleural
surfaces are otherwise normal."" The results were discussed with
the patient's wife and she was told to follow this up with her
primary physician.

Brief Hospital Course:
On 2025-04-10, she underwent segmental liver resection for
symptomatic left liver hemangioma. Surgeon was Dr. David Gonzalez. Intraop ultrasound was done. Numerous small hemangiomas
were noted. The most anterior hemangioma was calcified and
easily palpable underneath the falciform (in the location of her
pain)therefore this was removed. There were no complications.
Please refer to operative note for complete details. An epidural
was placed pre-operatively in the PACU. She experienced a
severe anxiety reaction which seemed to worsen after the
administration of a benozodiazepine which was partially
alleviated by Haldol.

Postop, on 2025-08-15, she had low grade temp 101. Tylenol was given.
Blood and urine cultures were sent. UA was negative. CXR
demonstated slight right pleural effusion.

Pain was managed with an epidural. PO intake was poor. And
benadryl was given for pruritus which made her sleepy. Epidural
was split with a Dilaudid PCA.

On postop day 2, pain was not well controlled and Toradol/ativan
were given. She was febrile again to 101 and was recultured.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started after repeat cultures. IV
fluid boluses as she had low urine output.

She experienced a large amount of clear/foul smelling vaginal
discharge. GYN was consulted. HCG was sent and was negative as
were cultures for BV, GC and Chlamydia. UA was positive, but
urine culture was negative.

She spike to 102 early am 2025-02-06. Incision appeared intact
without redness or drainage. Pain service removed the epidural
and the foley was removed. She denied headache and there were no
mental status changes. IV Vanco and Zosyn were started which
were later changed to cipro and flagyl on 2025-03-15.

She remained afebrile with stable vital signs. Dilaudid was
increased to 6mg for each dose for c/o pain at incision. She was
slow to move and ambulate, but improved on posotp day 7 when she
was oob.

Creatinine increased to as high as 3.8 likely from a combination
of IV Vanco, Toradol and hydration status. Vanco was changed to
cipro/flagyl and toradol was stopped. Subsequent creatinines
decreased down to 1.4 by day of discharge. At time of discharge,
she was instructed to have chemistries checked on 2025-01-01.

She was feeling better at time of discharge, tolerating diet and
ambulating independently. Pathology report was finalized as
cavernous hemangioma.

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Douglas Scott is a 1990 with previously known cholelithiasis who
presents with nausea, epigastric pain, RUQ tenderness and
gallbladder wall edema c/f acute cholecystitis. She has
experienced episodic 1/10 (mild) burning, epigastric pain radiating to
her back since 2025-08-12, occasionally associated with nausea and
malaise. Symptoms are exacerbated by eating food. She was
previously evaluated for this at North Seanport, where her
work-up included an EGD that showed no ulcer or visible
abnormality, a RUQ US that showed cholelithiasis and gallbladder
wall thickening but no pericholecystic fluid, biliary ductal
dilatation or sonographic Gallstones seen in gallbladder, and a HIDA scan that
demonstrated 12% ejection fraction. An elective cholecystectomy
was planned at that time as Mrs. Douglas Scott was about to go to Rehabilitation Center
for three weeks and didn't want to sacrifice her trip. Symptoms
continued through the vacation but were manageable until last
night when her pain became 9/10 (very severe) and she had extreme nausea and
multiple episodes of NBNB emesis. Following this acute
exacerbation she presented to Community Clinic for evaluation.

IMAGING STUDIES

LIVER / GALLBLADDER US (2025-04-16)
1. Stone within the gallbladder lumen measures up to 2.2 cm.
There is no
sonographic evidence of cholecystitis.

2. Mildly echogenic liver suggests hepatic steatosis. Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
steatohepatitis or
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
this study.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (2025-04-16)
1. Mildly distended gallbladder with multiple gallstones and an
edematous
wall. Considering the history and the recent ultrasound, these
findings are equivocal, however acute cholecystitis remains a
consideration.
2. No intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
3. Prominent cluster of lymph nodes within the right mid
abdomen, which are nonspecific, but can be seen with mesenteric
adenitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Douglas Scott was admitted on 2025-06-17 under the acute care surgery
service for management of her acute cholecystitis. She was taken
to the operating room and underwent a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Please see operative report for details of this
procedure. She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated
upon completion. She was subsequently taken to the PACU for
recovery.

She was transferred to the surgical floor hemodynamically
stable. Her vital signs were routinely monitored and she
remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was initially
given IV fluids postoperatively, which were discontinued when
she was tolerating PO's. Her diet was advanced on the morning of 2025-06-07 to regular, which she tolerated without abdominal pain,
nausea, or vomiting. She was voiding adequate amounts of urine
without difficulty. She was encouraged to mobilize out of bed
and ambulate as tolerated, which she was able to do
independently. Her pain level was routinely assessed and well
controlled at discharge with an oral regimen as needed.
On 2025-01-03, she was discharged home with scheduled follow up in
Apollo Medical Center clinic on 2025-07-10.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Douglas Scott,

You were admitted to the hospital with acute cholecystitis. You
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and
are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the
following instructions.

Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the
appointment listed below.

ACTIVITY:

o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs.
o You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o Don't lift more than 105 kg lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you
can resume tub baths or swimming.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL:
o You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your
throat during surgery.
o You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping.
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem
unappealing.
o All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go
away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon.

YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks.
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe,
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may
resume tub baths or swimming.

YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"".
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on 2025-04-28 and taken to the operating room
by Dr. Nicole White a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and
cholangiogram. There were no intraoperative complication and
patient tolerated procedure without difficulty. However, during
cholangiogram, with visualization of the bile duct system, it
was very clear that there was no filling of the duodenum and
that there was a meniscus-like cut off
structure at the base. This persisted over time and with a lot
of forceful flow. The rest of the cholangiogram was normal with
the exception of the fact that there was a
dilated bile duct well over a centimeter in size. The hepatic
ducts were visualized and there was no evidence of
extravasation. To rule out possibility of a impacted stone at
the distal aspect of the bile duct, ERCP was scheduled on POD1.
Patient was extubated and taken to the PACU for monitoring. She
was then transferred to the general surgical floor for further
recovery.

On POD1, patient was kept NPO with IVF. She was taken for ERCP.
Procedure and findings consistent with the following: (1) Normal
major papilla, (2) Cannulation of the biliary duct successful
and deep with a sphincterotome, (3) Mild diffuse dilation was
seen at the main duct with CBD measuring 11mm, (4) Filling
defect that appeared like sludge in the lower third of the CBD,
(5) Sphincterotomy was performed successfully using a
sphincterotome over an existing guidewire, (6) A 11.5mm balloon
was used and the stone fragments were removed successsfully.
Patient kept NPO during the night.

On POD2, patient advanced to clear and full liquid diet. She
tolerated without issues. Pain controlled with appropriate oral
analgesics. She is passing flatus. Ambulating and voiding
without difficulty.

On POD3, the patient was tolerating a regular diet. Pain
controlled with an oral regimen. Continuing to ambulate and void
without difficulty.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Preston is a 2002 w/ complicated PMH including multiple
abdominal surgeries including s/p fundoplication, pyloroplasty,
gastrojejunostomy, sphincteroplasty, CBD stent, intestinal
dysmotility s/p sigmoid stricture dilation, numerous ERCPs and
billiary stents placed due to recurrent stones and sludge who
presents with intractable RUQ pain.
She most recently underwent a cholangiogram on 2025-02-21 per Patrick Jackson
which showed a moderate stenosis of the ampulla. She underwent
ampullary balloon plasty and a right internal/external biliary
catheter was placed. Since that time the pt has continued to
have RUQ pain requiring multiple hospitalizations and clinic
visits. She reports that over the past 4 days she has
experienced subjective fevers/chills as well as acute worsening
of her RUQ pain associated with nausea. Today, she developed
shaking chills with abdominal pain radiating to her right
shoulder. She has had minimal output from her biliary catheter,
but she says over the weekend, her drain appeared to be
""clogged"". She has been able to take POs and denies any vomiting
or diarrhea.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Preston is a 2002 female with a complex past surgical history
who underwent Right PTBD placement and ampullary balloon plasty
on 2025-06-21 for ampullary stenosis who presents with severe right
upper quadrant pain and found to have a subcapsular liver
abscess.

# Subscapular liver abscess:
# Sepsis:
Thought to be due to leakage of bile around PTBD that was
recently placed. Patient underwent Ultrasound guided aspiration and
drainage with JP drain placed. Patient placed on Zoysn on
admission. Leukocytosis, fevers improved with therapy. ID
consulted for antibiotic course and recommended Zosyn 4.5g Q8h
for 2 weeks with follow up to determine further course. PICC
line placed on this admission and home infusion set up. On
discharge, there was minimal output from JP drain. She will
follow up with General City Hospital 1 week for evaluation and possible removal
of JP drain.

#Ampullary Stenosis: Recent admission for PTBD placement with
ampullary dilatation. Followed by Urology of Meganshire and Dr.
Estrada Jill. PTBD was uncapped on discharge per Patrick Jackson instructions.

# Malnutrition: Current weight 95lbs. Patient is under ideal
body weight likely due to recurrent illness and RnY surgery.
Does not want TPN or TF which she has had after procedure the past. Continued
vitamin supplements and ensure with meals.

# GERD/esophageal dysmotility. Last EGD and mannometry on 2025-06-21
with evidence of ineffective esophageal contractions and
positive impedence acid reflux study correlating 100% with
symptoms. Symptoms at home have been stable on home Protonix and
Reglan. Has not required use of NTG for esophageal spasms.

# Hx of Hashimoto thyroiditis. Continued home levothyroxine.

#Recurrent UTI's: On suppressive macrobid therapy chronically.
This was held while on Zosyn and NOT restarted.

Transitional Issues:
-Zosyn 4.5g Q8H for 2 weeks or until determined by ID
-Will need to follow up with Green Valley Hospital for removal of JP drain within 1
week
-CBC w/diff, BUN, Cr drawn weekly and faxed to Neurosurgery Unit
Attn: Cleveland Health Institute CLINIC
-Suppressive Macrobid stopped while on Zosyn
-You stated you have a yeast infection and provided prescription

Assessment and Plan:
2002 with PMH gout and 2025-05-01 aortic dissection s/p repair and s/p
L VATS evacuation of hematoma p/w fever, vomiting, and dysuria
with urine cultures growing pan-sensitive klebsiella.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Complicated UTI: Urine cultures growing pan-sensitive
klebsiella. Complicated given male gender. Three days PTA,
patient was started on 2025-07-20 urgent care, but
could not tolerate PO intake of abx and thus was likely
under-treated. Unlikely superimposed pyelonephritis given no CVA
tenderness and resolving symptoms. Unlikely nephrolithiasis
given no stones or hydro seen on US and no history of colicky
abdominal pain. Given low suspicion for pyelo or
nephrolithiasis, CT was deferred. Patient was started on
ceftriaxone in the ED, which was switched to ciprofloxacin 500
mg BID (2025-01-15) once cultures returned showing Klebsiella which
was pan-sensitive. Patient should remain on cipro for 10 day
course, through 2025-07-15. By discharge, patient's dysuria,
nausea and vomiting had resolved and he remained afebrile.

# Pulmonary: Baseline creatinine 1.3, 1.7 on admission, trended to 1.6
after fluids. Likely pre-renal ISO poor PO intake rather than
obstruction given no hydro or stones seen on US. Given slow
resolution of Creatinine, patient was continued on maintenance
fluids. By discharge, creatinine returned to baseline of 1.3. 2025-07-07
Home allopurinol was re-dosed renally (300 mg --200 mg daily)
given Elderly while inpatient and he was discharged on his home
dose.

# ?BPH: Patient has no known history of BPH, however renal
ultrasound 2025-07-03 showed bladder wall thickening secondary to
chronic outlet obstruction from BPH. Given this as well as
remote possibility of nephrolithiasis, patient started on
tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO QHS. Patient should follow up with PCP to
decide whether to stay on this medication.

# Anion gap: Likely starvation ketosis ISO poor PO intake.
Resolved with maintenance fluids.

# Thrombocytopenia: Likely ISO acute infection. Patient should
have CBC checked at next PCP 2025-07-13.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# H/o Type B aortic dissection in 1990: patient continued on
home metoprolol succinate XL 25 mg daily and home asa.

# Hyperlipidemia: continued home atorva

# H/o gout: Patient on allopurinol at home, re-dosed renally
given Elderly (300 mg --> 200 mg qHS). Discharged on home dose once
Platelets: 250,000 /ÂµL improved. Patient also continued on home colchicine 0.6 mg
3x/week.

# H/o provoked DVT in 1979, heterozygote Factor 5 Leiden: s/p
warfarin for 3 mo.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
N/A Please repeat CBC in 1 month to monitor thrombocytopenia.
Consider further work-up outpatient if persistent.
N/A Continued on Flomax on discharge given ? BPH. Please
discontinue or adjust medication as necessary.
N/A Last of ciprofloxacin 2025-02-28 for a total 10 day course.
N/A Consider urology evaluation if recurrent UTIs or further
evaluation of BPH.
N/A CTA torso scheduled to monitor aortic dissection for 2025-04-30.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Ortiz,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay
at Mercy Health Hospital. You were hospitalized
for nausea, vomiting and fevers.

You were found to have a urinary tract infection that was likely
undertreated before you came into the hospital given that you
were not able to tolerate oral antibiotics. An ultrasound of
your kidneys showed that the infection had not spread to your
kidneys and also showed no kidney stones. In the hospital you
were given fluids and your symptoms improved. We gave you oral
antibiotics which you tolerated well. You should continue taking
this antibiotics for a total of 10 days, through 2025-07-15.

We also started you on a medication called Flomax that can help
patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, a benign condition
in which the prostate enlarges, commonly occurring in men as
they age. It can cause difficulty urinating (initiating a stream
and/or feeling like the bladder will not completely empty). If
you feel these symptoms, please follow up with your primary care
physician.

If you feel fevers, chills, pain with urination, nausea or
vomiting, please see your primary care physician.

Please continue to follow up with your primary care physician,
and specialists upon discharge from the hospital. Please
continue to take your home medications as prescribed.

Take Care,
Your Rheumatology Specialty Clinic Team.

Followup Instructions:
Check blood pressure at home twice daily and maintain a log."

Chief Complaint:
L distal femur nonunion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L distal femur revision ORIF with retrograde intramedullary nail

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Daryl Stewart is a 2022 old man with h/o amyloid ESRD
on HD, Crohn's disease, colorectal CA s/p APR with chemoRT, HTN,
who sustained a fall in 2025-07-02 with a L distal femur
fracture, s/p metal plate. This was poorly healing and he has
had persistent L leg pain. He presents today for left femur ORIF
with removal of hardward and placement of retrograde nail.
He tolerated this procedure without issue, but post-operatively
was noted to have a fever to 102.5, tachycardia to 130s sinus,
hypoTN to 100/86 mmHg. This was further complicated by the fact that his
AV fistula was found to be thrombosed this morning and he
currently has no access for HD. Per nephrology, he is now being
given slow fluids, and he is on a low dose of neo with stable
BPs
and improved tachycardia. Jennifer Khan to perform fistulogram in AM. Of
note he did have 2 teeth pulled yesterday without any issue. He
has not had any fevers prior to today in the recent past, and has
not had a cough. He does not make significant urine.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
=====================
Mr. Daryl Stewart is a 2022 year old male with a significant medical history of Crohn's Disease, ESRD due to amyloidosis (HD MWF), hypertension, colorectal CA s/p APR with chemotherapy and radiation, fractured L distal femur in 2025-07-02 from a mechanical fall s/p Oxygen therapy, 2025-01-07
complicated by nonunion now s/p L femur ORIF on 2025-02-15
complicated by post op fever, hypotension, and encephalopathy.

#Shock of unknown etiology versus septic shock: The patient initially presented for an elective L femor ORIF on 2025-02-15 which was complicated by immediate post-op fever, tachycardia, and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/cefepime) on 2025-06-22, however given no clear infectious source, his antibiotics were stopped. CT AP and TTE were without evidence of an abscess or other infectious pathology. The differential diagnosis for his likely sepsis included transient bacteremia in the setting of ORIF vs. bacteremia from his recent tooth extraction. In addition, the patient is immunosuppressed due to ongoing treatment with certolizumab for his Crohn's disease.

#Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy:
#ACA/MCA Watershed Infarct / Ischemic strokes: The patient's altered mental status was likely multifactorial due to hypotension resulting in punctate bilateral acute to subacute infarcts in ACA/MCA watershed regions as revealed on MRI brain 2025-06-21, due to hypoperfusion in the post operative setting. Over the course of his ICU stay, his mental status improved, however he became fairly delirious. His delirium was thought be due to ICU delirium, or a superimposed infection/bacteremia and improved tremendously to his baseline after starting PO Haldol 0.5 mg BID with psychiatric input. Of note, his EEG was without seizure activity. There was no evidence of drug induced mental status changes or electrolyte abnormalities. His carotid series revealed less than 40% stenosis in his carotid arteries.

#ESRD on HD: The patient has end stage renal disease in the setting of AA amyloid presumably from his Crohn's disease. He is s/p AVF declotting on 2025-01-03. On HD MWF at home. He was euvolemic throughout his hospitalization without signs of uremia.

#L distal femur nonunion: The patient is status post ORIF on 2025-02-15 without surgical site complications. The patient had a persistent left knee effusion that was tender to palpation, but he had warm and well perfused extremities and intact active range of motion. LLE ultrasound was negative for DVT and revealed a moderate effusion. This was likely due to a hematoma or seroma.

#Anemia: Hgb 9.8 on admission and slowly downtrended during his hospitalization. He had 3 uPRBC during his stay and was transfusion responsive. This was a normocytic anemia likely due to ESRD and his recent surgery, that was likely exacerbated by poor nutritional status from Crohn's disease s/p vit K repletion. Additional factors include antibiotic induced coagulopathy or amyloid induced bone marrow suppression. He was stable with no source of active bleeding at the time of discharge.

#Thrombocytopenia: The differential diagnosis included drug induced thrombocytopenia in the setting of broad spectrum antibiotics, or infection/sepsis induced thrombocytopenia. This too could also have been exacerbated by poor nutrition status and AA amyloidosis. His PF4 antibodies were negative for HIT.

#Pruritis: The differential diagnosis included dry skin given altered mental status and it was unclear if he was using sarna lotion. Other considerations included delusional parasitosis. LFTS were within normal limits, suggesting this was not a biliary induced pruritis.

CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:
#Crohn's disease: The patient is currently on certolizumab at home. His Crohn's disease was asymptomatic during the hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Daryl Stewart,

You came to UnityPoint Hospital because you had left knee pain after your femur fracture. Please see more details listed below about what happened while you were in the hospital and your instructions for what to do after leaving the hospital.

It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your Inpatient Care Team Care Team

===================================
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE HOSPITAL?
===================================
- You were found to have a poorly healing left left after your fracture in 2025-07-27. You had further knee surgery for your broken leg.
- After the procedure, you were found to have a fever and low blood pressure. You were treated with antibiotics with the concern for infection.
- You also became confused and were found to have several strokes in your brain because of poor blood flow. You were started on a medication called Haldol, due to ongoing confusion, and you improved significantly.
- You also had a blood clot in your fistula for dialysis. This was repaired and you were continued on dialysis.
- Finally, you had low blood counts throughout your hospitalization, you were transfused and improved. Your low blood counts were likely caused by inflammation in your body, medications that were used in the hospital to treat your infection, and your underlying kidney failure.
==================================================
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
==================================================
INSTRUCTIONS AFTER ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY:

- You were in the hospital for orthopedic surgery. It is normal to feel tired or ""washed out"" after surgery, and this feeling should improve over the first few days to week.
- Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.

ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT BEARING:
- WBAT LLE

MEDICATIONS:
- Please take all medications as prescribed by your physicians at discharge.
- Continue all home medications unless specifically instructed to stop by your surgeon.
- Do not drink alcohol, drive a motor vehicle, or operate machinery while taking narcotic pain relievers.
- Narcotic pain relievers can cause constipation, so you should drink eight 8oz glasses of water daily and take a stool softener (colace) to prevent this side effect.

ANTICOAGULATION:
- Unless directed otherwise by the Medicine team, please take subcutaneous heparin twice daily to prevent formation of blood clots

WOUND CARE:
- You may shower. No baths or swimming for at least 4 weeks.
- Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken out at your 2-week follow up appointment.
- Please remain in your dressing and do not change unless it is visibly soaked or falling off.

DANGER SIGNS:
Please call your PCP or surgeon's office and/or return to the emergency department if you experience any of the following:
- Increasing pain that is not controlled with pain medications
- Increasing redness, swelling, drainage, or other concerning changes in your incision
- Persistent or increasing numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation
- Fever > 101.4
- Shaking chills
- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea or vomiting with an inability to keep food, liquid, medications down
- Any other medical concerns

Followup Instructions:
Continue wound care with daily dressing changes as instructed."

Headache Complaint:
hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation 2025-05-16
Extubation 2025-01-24

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Francis is a 1977 y/o woman with a PMH of alcohol use disorder,
recurrent falls, depression, and anxiety, with a recent
hospitalization for hypercarbic respiratory failure (2025-06-11)
and EMG findings concerning for ALS, who presents from Pulmonology Clinic New Sharon with worsening respiratory distress and
hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Per previous discharge summary:
""Her symptoms have been ongoing since 2025-05-12, and she has had
multiple falls with concussions. She has also had worsening
dyspnea with exertion. She was initially admitted to UnityPoint Hospital
in East Michaelbury for these symptoms, which were thought to be related
to dementia and depression, and she was planned for transfer to
a geriatric psychiatry unit for further evaluation. She and her
family refused, however, and she returned home. Over the
following weeks, she continued to decline, with progressive
weakness, confusion, and continued falls. She had had a 40 pound
weight loss in 5 months. She reportedly spent most of the day in
bed due to weakness and fatigue. She developed right foot drop
after a fall, resulting in edema and progressive debilitation at
home, which led her to return to the ED at Medanta The Medicity.
Due to concern at Medanta The Medicity for progressive neurologic disease,
patient was transferred to Medanta The Medicity on 2025-03-25 for further workup.
Here she was briefly in the ICU requiring BiPAP for hypercarbic
respiratory failure, and eventually able to be transferred to
the floor. An initial neurologic workup was significant for a CT
chest/abd/pelvis (done at Medanta The Medicity) to rule out occult malignancy,
making L-E unlikely. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies and MuSK
antibodies were also negative, ruling out both classic and
AChR-negative myasthenia Ocular. RPR negative, MMA normal, B12
on the lower limit of normal and she was started on B12
supplements 1000mcg PO daily.
Ultimately, an EMG showed was significant for motor
neuron-predominant axon loss, concerning for an anterior horn
cell disorder. It was felt that findings were most consistent
with ALS - however, a primary muscular disease could not be
completely ruled out. Neurology Dept Neuromuscular Disease requested
outpatient follow up for further testing.

The patient was discharged from Medanta The Medicity to rehab on 2025-07-19. However,
over the next few days she developed worsening respiratory
distress, and was transferred to General City Hospital, where she
was found to have a CO2 > 100, and therefore was started on
BiPAP and transferred to General City Hospital. A CXR there was negative for
pneumonia.

In the ED, initial vitals: 98.2, HR 107, BP 110/67, RR 18, 98%
BiPAP
- Labs were notable for:
CBC WBC 5.2, Hgb 11.5, Plt 158
Lytes: Na 141, K 5.6, Cl 98, CO2 32, UBN 25, Cr 0.5, Gluc 128,
Ca ALT: 30 U/L, Mg 2.1, P 4.3
Trop 0.02
Initial VBG: 7.36, CO2: 76. The patient was trialed off of
bipap, but became more somnolent and CO2 increased to 89, so was
placed back on bipap with improvement in mental status. However,
she continued to decompensate, requiring intubation for
respiratory failure

On arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated

Past Medical History:
-Alcohol use disorder
-Recurrent falls complicated by concussions
-Hypertension
-Hyperlipidemia
-Chronic anxiety with depressed mood
-Pulmonary hypertension (PASP 51 mmHg, TTE 2025-02-27)
-Moderate aortic regurgitation
-Osteopenia
-Failure to thrive

Social History:
Never smoked
Family History:
No family history of neurologic disease. Her mother had colon
cancer and her father CHF.

IMAGING:
=====================
CXR 2025-03-28:
FINDINGS:
A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal
tube
terminating in the upper trachea and an enteric tube extending
below the
diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image, again with the
side-hole
likely at the GE junction. Lungs are fairly well expanded. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
Increasing opacity in the left lower lung may reflect sequela of
aspiration or mucous plugging. A skin fold over the right upper
lung should not be mistaken for pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
Increasing opacity over the left lower lung may reflect sequela
of aspiration or mucous plugging.

CXR 2025-03-28:
FINDINGS:
A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an
endotracheal tube terminating in the upper thoracic trachea and
an enteric tube descending below the diaphragm into the stomach,
but with the side hole just proximal to the GE junction. This
can be advanced several cm to be placed within the stomach. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Lungs are well-aerated
without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
Left base atelectasis is noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
2. Enteric tube terminating within the stomach, but with the
side hole just proximal to the GE junction in the distal
esophagus. This can be advanced several cm in order to be
placed within the stomach.

PREVIOUS PERTINENT IMAGING:
EMG (2025-01-31):
Complex abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic findings are
most consistent with a generalized ongoing and chronic
neurogenic process which is motor- predominant and characterized
by axon loss. However, the prominent polyphasia, abundance of
complex repetitive discharges, and small fibrillation potentials
also raises the possibility of a primary myopathy. There is no
evidence of a generalized polyneuropathy or pre-synaptic
disorder of neuromuscular transmission.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Francis is a 1977 y/o woman with a PMH of alcohol use disorder,
recurrent falls, depression, and anxiety, with a recent
hospitalization for hypercarbic respiratory failure (2025-06-11)
and EMG findings concerning for ALS, who presented from Pulmonology Clinic New Sharon with worsening respiratory distress and
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
.
>> ACTIVE ISSUES:
# GOALS OF CARE: After reviewing Ms. Francis's clinical course, it
became clear that she has been declining significantly for a
year, to the point where she is unable to care for herself at
home. The hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely a function
of worsening progressive neuromuscular disease, which is
concerning for ALS, although the diagnosis is not entirely
clear. Family meeting between team members and family (husband,
and 2 sons) to discuss her decline and prognosis. The son
reported that he had a recent conversation with the patient,
where she reported that she would not want to be intubated or
trached. The decision was made to terminally extubate the
patient with the family at the bedside, with plan to discharge
to hospice.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Second hypercarbic
respiratory failure event in 2 weeks (previously was in the ICU)
and discharged to rehab on BIPAP at night. Etiology of
respiratory failure thought to be secondary to progressive
neuromuscular weakness, with possible contribution for left
hemidiaphragm paralysis. She was intubated on 2025-05-16 for
hypercarbia. However, clinical picture not entirely clear as she
had intermittent NIFs in the --50 cmH2O. However, overall clinical
deterioration and progression was consistent with underlying
neuromuscular disease. Family decided to terminally extubate the
patient on 2025-01-24 due to the patient's previously discussed
wishes.

# Neuromuscular weakness - Patient has undergone extensive
workup for neuromuscular weakeness at General City Hospital and during her
previous admission. No signs of malignancy to suggest that this
is paraneoplastic. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies and MuSK
antibodies were also negative, ruling out both classic and
AChR-negative myasthenia Ocular. RPR negative, MMA normal, B12
on the lower limit of normal. EMG was concerning for anterior
horn cell disorder. Patient was to have outpatient workup for
ALS. Neurology was consulted on this admission, and acknowledged
the unclear clinical picture. However, given goals of care
discussion and the fast progression of her respiratory failure,
plan was to terminally extubate and transition to hospice.

# Transaminitis - Seen during previous admission, thought to be
secondary to alcohol use. Resolved on this admission.

# Alcohol use disorder - Reportedly sober since 2025-07-05.
Thiamine, folate, MVI, B12 supplementation

# Depression/anxiety -
- held mirtazapine 7.5mg QHS

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 2004 year old right-handed female history of a.fib
off coumadin, and HTN, who presents from an outside hospital
with
a likely MCA stroke after being given tPA at Houston Methodist Hospital and
transferred here for possible intra-arterial intervention.

The patient was at home with her husband returning from a
Requires assistance dinner. They went to bed at 21:30. At around
22:15
the husband was Responded by a gurgling sound coming from his wife.

He looked over and asked her questions but she was unable to
respond. Her daughter came over and noted that her face was
asymmetric, but could not remember which side. She also noted
that the patient did not appear to comprehend. EMS arrived on
22:50, and she was taken to Houston Methodist Hospital. She had a CT,
which
was reportedly read as normal (but on our read here has a
hyperdense MCA) and she was noted to have global aphasia, right
sided weakness and left gaze deviation. He put the NIHSS 5 scale at
least 16 but he was not able to do a full scale secondary to
aphasia. She was bolused with tpA at 23:50 and started on the
infusion. She had finished the infusion by the time she arrived
at St. Georgeâs University Hospital.

On arrival the patient was initial not responsive to voice and
commands per ED team. On arrival the patient was able to open
her eye to sternal rub, was spontaneously moving the left arm
and
had a leftward gaze deviation. The patient was globally aphasic,
with no comprehension, and was not following commands. She was
intubated for airway protection. She then had a CTA/P, and it
was noted that there were new hemorrhages on the CT, and any
further intervention was deferred.


NIHSS 5 Stroke Scale score was 32:
1a. Level of Consciousness: 2
1b. LOC Question: 2
1c. LOC Commands: 2
2. Best gaze: 2
3. Visual fields: 2

7. Limb Ataxia: 0
8. Sensory: 1
9. Language: 3
10. Dysarthria: 2
11. Extinction and Neglect: 2

On neuro ROS, per family the patient had not complained of a
headache. They noted that she had an episode of right leg
weakness 3 days prior which seemed to resolve on its own. She
had chronic back pain, and had some mild difficult walking at
baseline. No No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.

On general review of systems, the family did not believe there
were any recent fever or chills, or infectious symptoms. No
cough/SOB, chest pain. No N/V.

Imaging:

CTA/P of head 2025-06-29:

IMPRESSION:

1. Findings consistent with an acute left MCA infarct, with loss
of gray-
white matter differentiation in the left middle cerebral artery
territory,
including the insular region and left basal ganglia. There is
thrombus in the supraclinoid segment of the left internal
carotid artery extending into the bifurcation and into the left
middle cerebral artery. There is marked asymmetry in the flow of
the left middle cerebral artery territory, with corresponding
perfusion abnormalities as detailed above.

2. Curvilinear hypodensity within the carotid bulb on the left,
which may
represent atherosclerotic disease versus an artifact. A
dissection flap is
considered less likely given that curvilinear hypodensity is
localized to the carotid bulb.

3. There is subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left hemisphere, new
since the
outside head CT from 2025-05-10 done only a short time prior to the
current
study.

4. Endotracheal tube in position. Orogastric tube incompletely
visualized.

5. Old right temporal infarct with encephalomalacia.

CTP: Image quality is degraded by poor signal to noise. There is

suggestion of asymmetric decreased cerebral blood volume and
blood flow,
without definite asymmetry on the mean transit time. This
correlates with the asymmetry on the CTA images in terms of the
enhancement, with the left
decreased compared to the right.

CTH 2025-06-29

IMPRESSION:
Unchanged acute ischemia in the left MCA territory and foci of
subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage

CTH 2025-06-29
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving left MCA distribution infarct with stable mass
effect on the left lateral ventricle.
2. Stable multifocal subarachnoid hemorrhage, with no new foci
of acute
hemorrhage.

CTH 2025-06-29:
Again seen is a large area of hypodensity within the left MCA
territory, consistent with expected evolution of infarct. The
degree of mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and
overlying sulcal effacement remains unchanged. The hyperdense
left MCA is again noted. Foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage are
also stable in extent and resolving. No new areas of hemorrhage
are seen. The ventricles remain stable in size.

IMPRESSION: Little change since prior study with evolving left
MCA
distribution infarct with stable mass effect. Stable extent of
multifocal
subarachnoid hemorrhage with no new areas of acute hemorrhage.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


2025-06-29 KUB xray:
The colon is gas-filled. There are no dilated loops of small
bowel. There is no evidence of obstruction. The side port of the
endogastric tube is within the stomach. There is no obvious
pneumoperitoneum, although the lack of a decubitus view limits
assessment of pneumoperitoneum. Degenerative changes are noted
throughout the spine.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
2004 year old LEFT-handed woman with atrial fibrillation (off
Coumadin) and HTN who presented from OSH with an MCA stroke and
after receiving IV tPA was transferred to St. Georgeâs University Hospital for question of
an intra-arterial intervention. On initial examination she was
noted to be globally aphasic with R sided weakness and
hemianopia, and L
gaze deviation. She appeared to not have improved significantly
after IV tPA and in the ED and became drowsy, with minimal eye
opening to voice and sternal rub. She was eventually intubated
for airway protection.

On follow up CTA/P she was noted to have SAH in the cortical
left frontal and left parietal lobes, felt to be due to tPA as
well as a thrombus in the supraclinoid segment of the left ICA
extending into the bifurcation and into the left MCA. CT
imaging here showed a dense MCA sign, along with a CTP showing L
decreased BV and BF. Due to new SAH, she was not a candidate
for intraarterial tPA and was admitted to Neuro-ICU to complete
post CVA care.

NEURO. Patient's BP was maintained < 180, goal of -500 cc I/O,
ASA and all anticoagulation were held due to concern for SAH,
which was confirmed on a subsequent CT. CT on 2025-08-04 also showed
mass effect due to increasing edema at the frontal horn of the
left lateral ventricle due to evolving infarct. At this time,
she was started on mannitol, HOB elevation and fluid restriction
w/ goal of -500 cc/day. With this treatment she slowly became
more alert and was extubated. Serial head CTs showed stable SAH
and evolving left MCA distribution infarcts with mass effect on
the left lateral ventricle without herniation.

Mannitol was weaned starting on 2025-02-07. She was transferred to
the floor an completely weaned off the mannitol. Given the size
of the infarct it was decided not to start her an a heparin
drip. Coumadin was restarted on 2025-07-25 and she will be titrated
for a goal INR of 0.8 â 1.2 (Normal range). Here LDL was noted to be 111 and she was
started on a statin at a low dose. Her blood sugar tests were
normal.

She will be discharged to a rehab facility to continue working
on her weakness and speech deficits.

CV. Patient remained in atrial fibrillation and had an episode
of afib with RVR to 170s. She was treated with diltiazem gtt
and started on PO diltiazem in addition to atenolol (she did not
respond to IV metoprolol). Her final dosage of diltiazem was
90mg QID. She has been scheduled for outpatient cardiology
follow up to help determine a suitable treatment for her atrial
fibrillation.

PULM. Patient was extubated on HD#3 without complications.

RENAL. No issues.

GI. She was treated with famotidine and TFs. She was noted to
aspirate with all consistencies of nutrition thus was maintained
on NGT and TFs. She repeatedly failed speech and swallow
evaluations and required the placement of a PEG feeding tube.
This was placed on 2025-07-01 without complications and tube feeds
were started the next morning. Adjust PEG bumper in 369 days,
with care not to over-tighten, as fat necrosis can occur

Medications on Admission:
- Atenolol 50 BID
- Simvastatin 20mg QD stopped taking a few weeks prior as she
heard it can cause weakness

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted as a transfer from an outside hospital for a
large stroke of the left side of your brain. You were initially
seen at an outside hospital were it was determined that you had
a large stroke of a blood vessel in your brain called the left
middle cerebral artery. You could not move your right side and
could not speak or understand language. You were given a clot
busting agent called tPa. You were not noted to improve
significantly and were transferred to St. Georgeâs University Hospital to see if there were
any other interventions that could be done. At St. Georgeâs University Hospital a follow
up CT scan of your brain showed that there was some small amount
of bleeding and it was determined that it was not safe to give
any other interventions, which could increase the bleeding.

You were transferred to the ICU, and were started on mannitol
because of concern of swelling of your brain. This was slowly
weaned off and you were transfered to the floor. You were
weaned of the mannitol. On the floor your exam has remained
largely unchanged but you have occasionally been able to make an
occasional sound. Physical therapy was able to have you bear
weight on your right leg.

As you were not able to swallow a PEG feeding tube has been
placed and your were started on tube feeds. You will be
transfered to a rehab facility to continue to work on improving
your strength.

Please take all medications as prescribed, please make all
follow up appointments. If you experience any of the symptoms
listed below please call your doctor or return to the nearest
emergency room.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms Hicks was admitted to labor and delivery for induction of
labor given her worsening chronic hypertension. She underwent a
vaginal delivery and had no clinical or laboratory evidence of
pre-eclampsia; therefore, magnesium was not given. She was
continued on oral labetalol and nifedipine.

Ms Hicks's postpartum course was complicated by dizziness and
nausea with ambulation. Her hematocrit and vital signs remained
stable and she did not have any evidence of anemia, hypovolemia,
or neurologic deficits. She had had similar symptoms in the past
while taking labetalol and the labetalol was discontinued. Her
blood pressures remained within goal on nifedipine alone and her
symptoms resolved.

Ms Hicks was discharged in stable condition on postpartum day #3.

Conclusions
Pre BYpass The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its
severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
Severe 4+ deep tendon reflexes tricuspid regurgitation is seen with eveidence of
hepatic systolic flow blunting/reversal, the annulus is 43mm.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. Nicholas Green was notified in
person of the results at the time of exam

Post Bypass: A well-seated annuloplasty ring the mitral
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 2 mmHg). No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no valvular
systolic anterior motion (Medication withheld).

A well-seated Tricuspid annuloplasty ring is seen with normal
leaflet motion . There is regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of inferior wall. The estimated
LVEF is 35-40 %. Right ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed.

CXR 2025-01-14: Good aeration, trace atelectasis.

KUB 2025-06-23: No dilated loops of bowel, constipation
.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on 2025-01-24 where
the patient underwent Mitral Valve repair and Tricuspid Valve
repair with Dr. Ryan Rodriguez. Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight. Warfarin was resumed for pre-op
AFib. He did remain in SR post-operatively. He developed a
leukocytosis. Central line was discontinued and urine culture
was negative. He remained afebrile and WBC trended down. The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication. The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By
the time of discharge on POD #7 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics. The patient was discharged to Oncology Department nursing
and rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Sanders,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at Gastroenterology Division. You were admitted
to the Podiatric Surgery service after your left foot surgery.
You were given IV antibiotics while here. You are being
discharged home with the following instructions:

ACTIVITY:
There are restrictions on activity. Please remain non weight
bearing to your Left foot until your follow up appointment. You
should keep this site elevated when ever possible (above the
level of the heart!)

No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.
PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).
New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.

Exercise:
Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks.
No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 21 days.
Try to keep leg elevated when able.

BATHING/SHOWERING:
You may shower immediately upon coming home, but you must keep
your dressing CLEAN, DRY and INTACT. You can use a shower bag
taped around your ankle/leg or hang your foot/leg outside of the
bathtub.

Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for 4
weeks after surgery or until cleared by your physician.

MEDICATIONS:
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the
medications you were taking before surgery.
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check
with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel
that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite

Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Leslie Fowler is a 2020 yo F with prior subtotal colectomy for
colonic inertia s/p end-ileostomy and recurrent bouts of
pancreatitis thought due to pancreatic stricture but she has had
more frequent flares since 2025-04-15 of unclear cause. She
underwent an ERCP on 2025-05-11 that was normal and completed a
course of steroids for possible autoimmune pancreatitis, but her
symptoms did not improve. She is not on narcotics at baseline.
She had a recent HCA visit on 2025-07-06 for hematuria and was found
to have a UTI. She was initially treated with 3 days of Bactrim,
but this was switched to ciprofloxacin on 2025-04-06. She also saw
Dr. Joanna Webb on 2025-07-06 and she was started on Elavil to begin
to treat her for chronic pain rather than acute pain. She took
the Elavil as prescribed daily, but she developed acute
worsening of her chronic abdominal pain today around 2pm. She
talked to Dr. Joanna Webb at that time and she opted to ""ride it
out"" and tried to take sips of water and stay hydrated, but she
was not able to get off the couch and could not eat. She also
describes periods earlier in the day where she could not drink
her coffee, she had a ""funny"" bad taste in her mouth, and even
lifesavers begain to cause her nausea. She began to have nausea
and vomited x1 (just bile) so she opted to come to the ER for
further treatment. She still had ostomy output throughout, but
she did note that her ostomy output changed prior to her pain so
that it was yellow and oily.

In ER, her VS were: T 98.9, BP 129/59, HR 102, RR 18, sats 100%
on RA. She described an acute flare in pancreatitis symptoms
(nausea, abdominal pain) since this afternoon. She was still
having ostomy output. She received 4mg IV zofran, a total of 8mg
IV morphine, and 1L NS. Her pain is mildly improved, but by the
time of my exam, she describes excruciating pain in her
epigastric area and reaching around to her back. She states that
she is never in a pain-free state, but that she can function at
a low level of Requires minimal assistance.

ROS:
denies any fevers or night sweats; + chills
denies any dizziness, LH, HA, visual changes
denies any rhinorrhea, congestion, cough or upper respiratory
symptoms
denies any chest pain, SOB, palpitations, or DOE
+ abdominal pain (described as ""focal"", in ""midepigastrium"" and

Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
Kristin Brady, nonsmoker with strong family history of CAD, p/w STEMI.
Patient was in USOH until three days prior to admission when he
noticed the onset of left-sided chest pain with radiation to the
right chest, left arm, neck, and periodically to his back. This
was not associated with SOB, n/v/diaphoresis. It occured at rest
and did not seem to be associated with activity. The patient
took a few regular aspirins with some relief of the pain but had
intermittent recurrences. He noted that this chest pain seemed
to be worse with supination and somewhat relieved by sitting up
or standing. On 2025-02-22 morning, he described his symptoms to a
nurse at the Green Valley Hospital (he works as an Teacher, early years/pre for some of the cath
lab equipment) and was advised to see his PCP. There, he had an
EKG done and was given aspirin and SL nitro and referred to the
ED.

In the ED, his VS were T 98.6, HR 110, BP 134/85, RR 16, and
O2sat 99%2L. He had an EKG performed which showed Q waves in the
inferior leads (III, aVF) and ST-segment elevation in I, aVL,
and V2-V5 (1mm). He also had evidence of a RBBB. He was given
aspirin, metoprolol, nitro, clopidogrel, and integrillin and
immediately sent for catheterization. There, he was found to
have an occluded RCA with collaterals and a 95% lesion in the
LAD. A BMS was placed in his LAD.
Note that the patient takes no medications and was previously on
atorvastatin, but has not taken this medication in a few years.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric ventricular hypertrophy with focal
hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall, distal anterolateral
wall, and true apex. Impaired left ventricular relaxation with
normal estimated filling pressures. Mild aortic root dilation.

CARDIAC CATH:

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease. The Diagonal Branch had no
flow-limiting stenoses. The LAD had a 95% stenosis in the
mid-vessel.
the LCX had no obstructive stenoses. The RCA was chronically
occluded
in the mid-vessel with brisk Left-to-Right vs Right-to-Right
collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial

hypertension.
3. Stenting of mid LAD with single Vision 2.75x23mm stent.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild systemic arterial hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Kristin Brady with strong family history of CAD presents with
STEMI.
.
# STEMI: Patient presented with a few days of chest pain and was
found to have an STEMI. A bare metal stent was placed in his
LAD and a completely occluded RCA was visualized, with good
collaterals. He was started on aspirin, a metoprolol,
lisinopril, atorvastatin, and clopidogrel, and was temporarily
taking eptifibatide. He was chest pain-free post-procedure. An
ECHO showed mild inferiolateral/apical hypokinesis of the left
ventricle. He was discharged with reccomendations to enroll in
cardiac rehabilitation and have a follow-up stress MIBI in a few
weeks to evaluate for reversible ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Emily Flores is a 2005 year old female with history of type 2
diabetes (DM2), chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatitine
4.0), obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on CPAP who
presented with leg swelling, generalized weakness, upper
respiratory symptoms, found to have acute-on-chronic renal
failure with creatinine to 5.5.

Acute Issues:
=================================
# Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, Creat was 5.5,
from baseline of 4.0. Patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency and nephrotic range proteinuria, likely from
diabetic nephropathy. Had AV fistula in 2025-06-04, with
superficialization 2025-03-15 in anticipation of dialysis. Urine
lytes (Fe urea 16.9%) consistent with pre-renal etiology.
     Renal was consulted and recommended started dialysis (HD)
during this admission. Before starting HD, she had a trial of
albumin with furosemide and metolazone to try to diurese the
fluid, which was mildly successful but she remained volume
overloaded and her BUN continued to rise to 140s. Medications
were renally dosed in consultation with pharmacy (pregabalin
dose was reduced), allopurinol, flexeril, and valsartan were
held. Creatinine was 2.4 on discharge. Her PPD was negative,
hepatitis serologies were negative and showed that hepatitis B
surface antibody negative.
     Her HD schedule as an outpatient will be Tuesday,
Friday, Friday. She should continue a low potassium, low phosphorus
diet and supplementation with nephrocaps, calcium, vitamin D,
and sevalamer for phosphorous-binding. Also, she was started on
epogen during this admission for anemia of chronic renal
failure.

# Anasarca: Likely related to acute renal failure as above. No
known heart failure, though no echo since 2025-02-12. Albumin was low
at 2.8, but likely not purely due to renal losses given only
mild proteinuria. She was diuresed with IV lasix 120mg BID, and
she ultimately had fluid management per HD as above. Her lasix
was discontinued upon discharge.

# Uremia: complained of myalgias, fevers, chills, upper
respiratory symptoms for 1 week. Influenza A/B DFA was
negative. Her symptoms ultimately improved with resolution of
uremia after HD initiated.

# Hyponatremia: Mild hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to
renal failure, Na 129 without any neurologic compromise. She
was placed on a fluid restriction to 1500 cc and allowed liberal
salt in her diet. Her Na was 139 on discharge.

# Type 2 Diabetes mellitus: Continued home Glargine 46U qHS.
Started humalog SS while in house for hyperglycemia with blood
glucose well controlled, but was discharged only on glargine and
her home exenatide.

# Hypertension: Held valsartan in the context of
acute-on-chronic renal failure, but continued clonidine, lasix,
isosorbide mononitrate & verapamil. Valsartan WAS NOT restarted
on discharge.

# Gout: Held allopurinol and colchicine in the context of
acute-on-chronic renal failure. However, after 5 days without
these medications and concurrent diuresis as above, she
developed an acute gout flare. She had erythema, edema, and
tenderness on her right hand at the PIP joint on Little finger digit and
also on the left hallux MCP joint, both with visible tophi. She
was started on prednisone 30 mg x 2 days with a 5 day taper.
NSAIDs and colchicine were avoided due to renal impairment. Her
allopurinal was re-started upon discharge.

# Chronic back/knee pain: Continued renally-dosed pregabalin.
Patient was recently started on cyclobenzaprine PRN by her PCP
for shoulder pain, though this was held this during the
admission, but was re-started upon discharge.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
================================
# Psoriasis: Continued clobetasol.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home dose of levothyroxine. TSH
rechecked and was 0.66.

# OSA: CPAP at night.

Transitional Issues:
====================================
#Hepatitis Serologies were negative, and it showed that she has
not been vaccinated against hepatitis B. Improving warrant vaccination
against hepatitis B.
#Consider restarting valsartan if necessary as an outpatient as
it was held during this admission
#Code: Full code (confirmed)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Emily Flores,
It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent
hospitalization.

You were admitted for increased fatigue, leg swelling and pain.
This was because your kidneys were not filtering your blood
appropriately and you were volume-overloaded. You were started
on hemodialysis and your symptoms improved. You will need to
get dialysis 3 days per week from now on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday,
Friday, Mon/Wed/Fri.

You were also started on prednisone to treat a gout flare.

Followup Instructions:
Continue physiotherapy sessions 3 times per week for rehabilitation."

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Nelson is a 1977 yo woman with a history of CAD and DM2
c/b Septic Shock due to Pneumonia transferred to County Medical Center from Private Physician Office today
due to a poorly healing and infected left foot s/p left Right 1st toe toe
amputation (Right arm above elbow).

Approximately 2 months ago, the pt noticed a peeling skin flap
on
her left heel. She pulled the flap but this exposed a deep
ulcer.
The ulcer was treated by her podiatrist, Dr. Jordan Morales, at
City Podiatry Center. About 2 wks ago during a f/u podiatry appt for
this
slowly healing left heel ulcer, a white blister was noted on the
left Right 1st toe toe. This was drained, revealing white pus which was
thought to be a gouty tophus at the time. The blister was
bandaged and she was prescribed indomethacin for pain. The pt
re-bandaged the blister daily, but noted on 2025-04-21 that overnight
the entire left Right 1st toe toe was necrotic and black/gray in color. She
also noted a low-grade fever/chills and Moderate malaise. She was
admitted emergently to the Mayo Medical Center that day
where an infection was found extending to the bone. The toe was
amputated with removal of metatarsal cartilage and vancomycin and
ertapenem antibiotics initiated. The incision site was cultured
(pending). Due to a poorly healing amputation stump and previous
operation with Dr. Jacqueline Sanders was transferred to our service
for
left Bilateral legs perfusion eval.

Relevant vascular history includes diabetic neuropathy with bilat
upper and lower extremity sensory loss and paraesthesias. Pt also
had previous left Right leg claudication when ambulating, though
currently she rarely ambulates far enough to elicit
claudication.
Previous claudications were relieved by standing up in place, and
some events were accompanied by left anterior thigh numbness.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Houston Methodist Hospital Vascular service on 2025-06-09. She was started on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl IV. Over the weekend, her wound improved slightly with the antibiotics. On 2025-04-21, she underwent ABI's (please see results in OMR). She also underwent an angiogram with stenting of her L common iliac artery (please see further details in operative note in OMR). Due to her low GFR, despite need for further assessment of her superficial femoral artery, the angiogram was not continued and it was decided that she would return in a few weeks time in order to complete this study and intervention. In the days post-procedure, her L wound infection appeared healthier than at admission, and her DP pulse on the L became palpable.

On 2025-04-21, she was assessed by the wound care team and was given recommendations as to how to care for her L foot wounds. She was also seen by Dr. Johnson, who deemed her ready for discharge home on a wheelchair and non-weight bearing on her L foot. She understood these plans as well as her follow up appointment times at the time of discharge.

Pertinent Results:
2025-01-16 CTA head and neck
1. Patent circle of Patricia Ferguson. No aneurysms.
2. Unchanged, approximately 50% stenosis of the left proximal
internal carotid artery by NASCET criteria. No evidence of right
internal carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria.
3. Unchanged large intraparenchymal hemorrhages in the left
frontal lobe with surrounding mass effect, edema, and 4 mm
left-to-right midline shift. No new intracranial hemorrhage.

2025-08-05 CXR:
Compared to the prior study there is no significant interval
change in the appearance of the lungs or chest. The Doppler off
tube is chest entering the stomach and is slightly high for use.
Consider advancing.

2025-08-05 CXR:
The feeding tube tip is in the distal stomach there remainder
the appearance of the lungs are unchanged. The right CP angles
off the film

2025-07-25 left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage has ruptured into the
left lateral ventricle and hemorrhage is now layering in the
occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle. Interval increase
in size of the ventricles since 2025-07-21 raises concern for
developing hydrocephalus.

2025-08-05 CXR:
Feeding tube is again seen with tip off the film, at least in
the stomach. Heart is minimally enlarged. There is no focal
infiltrate or effusion

2025-05-27 KUB:
Bowel gas pattern is within normal limits.

Brief Hospital Course:
2025-03-18, Mr. Joseph Wheeler was admitted to the trauma ICU after he was
administered 1 pack of platelets in the emergency department for
home aspirin and pravastatin use. He underwent a CTA of the head
and neck that demonstrated a stable head bleed with no evidence
of intracranial abnormalities.
On 2025-02-22, the patient remained stable and his cervical collar was
cleared after reviewing his cervical CTA. His daughter confirmed
that he was full code.
On 2025-02-22, the patient remained neurologically and hemodynamically
stable. However, over night the patient pulled his foley with
some sanguinous drainage, + void today with some post void
residual, will continue to monitor. He failed his bedside
swallow with RN, a formal S&S consult was obtained and
recommended nectar thick fluids and pureed solids. The patient
was transferred to the floor. Physical therapy and occupational
therapy evaluated the patient and recommended rehab. DNR status
was discussed with the daughter, will plan to discuss with
siblings and decide in the next couple of days.

On 2025-02-22, the patient was making small improvements in his
neurologic status according to his family. Mr. Joseph Wheeler was eating
an oral diet with the assistance of nursing, but was at high
risk of aspiration, so needed close supervision during meals.

On 2025-02-22, Mr. Joseph Wheeler exam improved. He was participatory with
the exam, following commands and stating his name. However,
later that morning, he was more somnolent and unable to
participate in a repeat formal swallowing exam. As a result,
the patient was kept on small, 4oz portions of soft foods under
the supervision of nursing.
On 2025-02-22, Mr. Joseph Wheeler exam worsened; he no longer followed
commands, he was unable to speak, no spontaneous movements.
After discussion with family, it was decided the patient would
not want a drain or surgery, however he remained full code. His
IVF were discontinued given his tube feed flusesh.
On 2025-02-22, Mr. Joseph Wheeler family established code status as DNR/DNI; an
insulin SS was started to stabilize his blood sugars. He also
developed coffee ground emesis x 1 however, the patient was
hemodynamically stable, and his SQH and enteral feedings were
stopped.
On 2025-02-22, a KUB x-ray was negative, and tube feeds re-started. He
had an episode of ventricular tachycardia and occasional PVCs.
Further workup (Lytes/Trop/EKG) were negative.
On 2025-02-22, Patient continued to be lethargic. Discussion with
family reguarding possible PEG tube placement vs CMO. Family to
discuss and let team know what they would like. CXR was obtained
for continued hiccups and coughing. The study was negative for
pneumonia.
On 2025-02-22 Patient was more alert on exmation. TFs were changed to
glucerna given persistently high blood glucose levels.

From 2025-01-19 to 2025-06-01, Mr. Joseph Wheeler neurologic exam showed no
improvement overall. He would open his eyes spontaneously and
to voice, but was not speaking or following commands. The
family was contacted to discuss whether Mr. Joseph Wheeler should undergo
a PEG placement. They were having difficulty making this
decision, so Palliative Care was consulted for their input and
consultation on 2025-07-10.

On 2025-02-22 the patient's respiratory status was deteriorating- not
clearing own secretions, requiring frequent suctioning, SPO2 88%
on RA, placed on 2L O2, deep suctioned with some response. He
triggered at 3:30 for respiratory status, tachypnea, and
tachycardia. His WBC increased to 23. He was started on
vanc/cefepime for presumed pneumonia. He was transferred to SDU.
Family contacted to come in and see patient. Family met with
Palliative Care and he was made CMO. He expired on 2025-07-21.

daughter and son-in-law are present and provide most of the
history. He started having nausea x1 day, poor appetite, and
feeling generally unwell. He did not take his medications x1
day. No po intake for the past 24 hrs. Family visited the
assisted care facility and noticed that he was disoriented and
had word fining difficulties and brought him to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: 97.9 80 20/min. Labs were
notable for normal WBC, Cr 1.0 ( at baseline), HCT of 38
(baseline), trop of 0.02(baseline), Mg 1.4, P 2.2, Na 148. CXR
unremarkable. UA was unremarkable. Patinet was evaluated by
neurology who did not feel he was having a stroke and
recommended CTA which showed 30% narrowing of the left carotid.
Head CT was negative. He was given 20 mg of IV labetalol and
zofran than started on a nicardipine drip. BP improved to the
160s systolic. He was admitted to the MICU for close monitor of
his blood pressure. Vital on transfer were 74 169/73 16 97% RA.

Of note, he was admitted in 2021 for hypertensive emergency
(208/91) and peripheral vertigo. During the admission, 2025-06-10,
MRI, CTA were negative for stroke or vasculopathy. He was also
admitted in 2021 with similar symptoms and was found to have
AMS d/t medications (tramadol).

On the floor, VS are 97.7 79 170/64 91 32 95% on RA. He is alert
and oriented x1 (person). He has word finding difficulty and is
disoriented per family. He is in charge of his own medications
and did not take them yesterday because of nausea. He was not
feeling well over the past day or two with nausea and poor
appetite. Last time he ate was over a day ago. He had frontal

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Robertson is an 1985 w/ h/o HTN, HLD, ?Acute Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack) p/w sudden onset
confusion and found to have hypertensive emergency.

# Acute hypertensive encephalopathy: Had word finding
difficulty, without other focal findings. Neuro c/s thought
unlikely to be stroke. Most likely due to hypertensive
encephalopathy. DDx include hypertensive encephalopathy vs.
metabolic/toxic vs. PRES vs. CVA vs infection vs. delirium vs.
medication-induced. Infectious cause less likely given UA and
CXR negative. TSH normal and RPR negative on last admission.
NCHCT and CTA not concerning for acute stroke. MRI showed no
acute hemorrhage or ischemic injury. Since pt has had similar
presentations in the past (expressive aphasia) and
confusion/disorientation w/ hypertension and ischemic w/u has
been negative, this is most likely d/t hypertension as well.
PRES less likely given headaches are frontal, no VS, no seizure.
At time of discharge, his mental status improved but he still
occasionally was confused and forgetful with word finding
difficulties.

# Hypertensive emergency: BP initially elevated to 220 systolic.
Treated in the MICU initially with IV labetalol in addition to
restarting home meds. Most likely d/t poor compliance with
medications v secondary causes of HTN. When transferred to the
floor, his home atenolol was replaced with labetalol for better
blood pressure effect and uptitrated as needed and his
lisinopril was uptitrated to 40mg from 20mg. His isosorbide
mononitrate was uptitrated. He was started on nifedipine as
well. On discharge BPs were 130s-150s. Goal SBP 130-160mmHg.

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin

# Anemia: H&H at baseline. Most likely d/t vit B12 deficiency.
continue vit B12.

# Chronic diastolic CHF: TTE done in 2020 did not show any
sign of CHF. EF>55% with mild MR and mild pulmonary HTN. Based
on records, Lasix and metolazone are most likely for Lake Charles edema.
His home diuretics were held on discharge because patient was
euvolemic during this admission. Also, he had Contrast exposure with acute
rise in creatinine after re-starting his diuretics.

# Shoulder/back pain: History of disc herniation and shoulder
pain. Patient is treated with Tylenol prn for pain. Narcotics
were avoided given altered mental status.

Transitional issues:
- medication compliance
- f/u as outpatient whether to re-start metolazone and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
- Follow urine/plasma metanephrines
- give 20mg PO hydralazine if SBP >180mmHg
- give 20mg IV hydralazine if SBP >200mmHg and notify MD
- uptitrate nifedipine v. isosorbide mononitrate as needed for
improved BP control.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Robertson,

You were hospitalized at Medanta The Medicity for very high blood pressure that
caused you to become confused. Your blood pressure was
controlled with medications and your confusion improved as well.
Please be sure to take all of your prescribed medications every
day. If you skip your blood pressure medications, you are at
risk of having very high blood pressures again and even a
stroke. While you were here, we stopped your diuretics lasix and
metolazone. You should follow up with your doctor to see if you
need to re-start these medications.

It will be very important for you to follow up with you primary
care physician to monitor your blood pressures.

TUMS, but this did not help. She did manage to go back to sleep,
but awoke at 5a with unremitting pain and did vomit. The vomitus
was digested food, no blood. Because the pain had not gotten
better, and was radiating now into her back, she went to Orthopedic Surgery Department for
evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
2015 y.o woman with h.o arthritis (? - she cannot clarify
further), heartburn who presented to OSH (Guyâs and St. Thomasâ Hospital) with CP and was
transferred to Manipal Hospitals for concern of symptomatic cholelithiasis.
Pt also had vomiting. Reportedly u/s at OSH with + Comet-tail artifact
sign, no gb wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.  MRCP here
found to have e/o acute cholecystitis, and pancreatitis.  She
improved rapidly with conservative management (ivf, abx, sips
only of clears), and underwent CCY on 2025-03-25

S/P CCY done by Brenda Saunders on 2025-03-25, Intra operative cholangiogram showed
CBD stones and ERCP done yesterday, no filling defects or stone
were seen.
MRCP earlier showed no choledocholithaisis.
RUQ
1.  Cholelithiasis and biliary sludge.
2.  No biliary ductal dilation.  No evidence of stones within
the
imaged
portion of the CBD.
3.  Normal sonographic appearance of the liver.

Patient underwent ERCP 2025-03-10,no stones, filling defects were
seen. After that she has been able to tolerate diet and stable
for discharged.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for evalaution of chest/abdominal pain and you
were found to have gallstones with acute cholecystitis and acute
gallstone pancreatitis and you underwent surgery for removal of
your gallbladder (cholecystectomy)

You were admitted to the hospital with acute cholecystitis. You
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and
are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the
following instructions.

Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the
appointment listed below.

ACTIVITY:

o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs.
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than 120 kg lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you
can resume tub baths or swimming.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL:
o  You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping.
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.

YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks.
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe,
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may
resume tub baths or swimming.

YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"".
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to
take, please call your surgeon.

Followup Instructions:
Check blood pressure at home twice daily and maintain a log."

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Sullivan is an 2010 year old 2022 only speaking female
with a history of Tuberculosis disease and HFpEF (LVEF >55% in
2025-02-27), who presented with increased shortness of breath.

Patient is a poor historian and per son she is mildly altered
from baseline. Per her son she called him early the morning of
admission reporting sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain. She
subsequently called +1-456-873-7831x874 | stephaniekeller@example.net the son described that she does not
like being in hospitals and calling 911 would be very atypical
for her. In the ED she endorsed mild dyspnea, and some degree of
chest discomfort that she was unable to further specify. Patient
reported chronic orthopnea, stating that she sleeps at 2
pillows.
Her son also noted altered mental status, which was a similar
presentation to previous UTIs. The patient reported dysuria and
foul smelling urine.

#In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.1 81 190/101 18 100% RA
- On physical exam, there was no evidence of respiratory
distress, lungs were clear, there was mild nonspecific abdominal
discomfort
- Labs were notable for lactate 1.1, trop<0.01, electrolytes
notable for hyponatremia Na 132, CBC within normal limits, AlkP
111. AST/ALT/bilirubin normal, lipase normal, proBNP elevated to
679, abnormal UA with elevated WBC and moderate bacteria,
negative Flu A/B
- Studies performed include CXR showing no consolidation and
central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary
edema,
- Patient was given aspirin 324 mg and ceftriaxone
- Vitals on transfer: 72 157/73 18 95% RA

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was overall comfortable
and in no acute distress, but tired. She was accompanied by her
son who helped with the translation. She was not short of breath
and chest pain free. She confirmed the history detailed above.

Brief Hospital Course:
2010 year old 2022 only speaking female with a history of
Tuberculosis disease and HFpEF (LVEF >55% in 2025-02-27), who presented
with increased shortness of breath, chest discomfort, and
confusion.

#Shortness of breath/chest tightness: Patient was found to have
negative trop, no new ECG changes, and no evidence of
consolidation on CXR. CXR was notable for pulmonary vascular
engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. On physical exam,
patient had mild crackles suggestive of volume overload in
context of elevated BNP, so she was diuresed with 10 mg IV
lasix. Her shortness of breath and chest discomfort resolved
before discharge and lungs were clear to auscultation. She was
discharged on Lasix 10 mg PO daily.

#UTI: She complained of dysuria and foul smelling urine, and was
found to have UTI. Patient has a history of recurrent
pan-sensitive E. coli UTI. Urine culture on his admission was
growing Proteus. She was initially treated with ceftriaxone and
transitioned to Cefpodoxime. Patient was contacted after
discharge, and antibiotics was changed to Ciprofloxacin 250 mg
PO BID based on culture sensitivities.

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:***
- Patient should complete 7 day course of Ciprofloxacin 250 mg
PO BID for treatment of UTI
- Patient was discharged on 10 mg Lasix PO, please assess her
volume status and readdress need to continue patient on this
medication and check electrolytes at f/u visit
- Patient will need TTE to evaluate for new worsening heart
failure and volume overload which was mild and responded to 10
mg Lasix.
- patient with slight elevation in TSH to 4.4. fT4 added on and
pending. Recheck thyroid studies as outpatient
- Discuss Code Status/Goals of Care
DISCHARGE WEIGHT: 50.5Kg
# Code Status: Full code, but does not want to be on machines
for a long term if poor prognosis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Sullivan,

St. Mary's Hospital was a pleasure taking care of you at Port Lacey. You came to the hospital because you were
experiencing shortness of breath and chest discomfort. You
underwent several tests which did not show any pneumonia or
heart attack. We were concerned about some fluid in the lungs,
for which we gave you medications to help get the fluid off your
body and you got better.
Also, you were found to have a urine infection. We started you
on antibiotics, which you should continue taking as prescribed.

Please make sure to take all your medications on time and follow
up with your doctors as Call the cardiologist immediately if chest pain or shortness of breath occurs.. Weigh yourself every morning,
call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

Best regards,
Your Urology Clinic team

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms Kirk was admitted to the Transplant/Liver Surgery service
following her elective laparoscopic cyst unroofing procedure on 2025-04-23. She tolerated the procedure well and was taken to
the PACU, then the floor for recovery. For details of the
operation, please see surgeon's operative report.

Pain was initially difficult to control. In the PACU, she
required Ketamine, Ativan, and IV narcotics to control her pain.
A Foley was placed at the end of the case due to concern for
urinary retention, this was removed and she voided
spontaneously. Whilst on the floor, her multimodal pain regimen
included Tylenol, Toradol for 48 hours then transitioned to
Ibuprofen, Gabapentin, Dilaudid, and Lidocaine. The Pain service
was consulted for assistance with managing pain; their
recommendations including more frequent Dilaudid, PO Ativan, and
increasing the dose of Gabapentin to 300 TID. They also
recommended that Lidocaine patches could be worn for up to 18
hours.

Her drain output was initially serosanguinous, but became more
bilious appearing during the hospitalization. A drain bilirubin
was sent which was 9.7. Her drain output decreased gradually and
was approximately 200cc/day on discharge.

By day of discharge, patient was tolerating a regular diet,
passing gas and having bowel movements, ambulating independently
and voiding spontaneously. She received drain care teaching and
was discharged home with drain in place. She will follow up with
Dr. Schedule imaging after 1 month to evaluate treatment progress. in clinic.

2. New focal expansion and increased T2 signal within the cord
at the C3-4
level. Some degree of underlying myelomalacia is suspected at
the C4-5 level.
3. Overall improvement in the degree of spinal canal narrowing
from C2-C7,
with the worst level, at C2-3, displaying mild to moderate
spinal canal
narrowing.

MR Head W/O CONTRAST Study Date of 2025-07-20 3:12 11:35 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Motion limited exam.
2. Prevertebral edema from the craniocervical junction through
C5-C6. No
clear evidence for anterior longitudinal ligament edema or
disruption, but
evaluation is limited by motion. No other evidence for
ligamentous edema or bone marrow edema.
3. From C3-C4 through C5-C6, there are disc protrusions and
endplate
osteophytes severely narrowing the spinal canal and compressing
the spinal
cord. At C6-C7, right paracentral disc protrusion endplate
osteophytes cause moderate spinal canal narrowing with ventral
spinal cord remodeling. There is patchy T2 hyperintensity in the
cord from C2-C3 through C6-C7 levels, which may represent
contusion in the setting of trauma, versus chronic myelomalacia
in the setting of spinal canal stenosis.
4. No evidence for acute traumatic injuries in the thoracic or
lumbar spine.
5. Multilevel lumbar degenerative disease. Spinal canal
stenosis is moderate to severe at L4-L5, and moderate at L3-L4

is also mass effect on multiple traversing and exiting nerve
roots, as detailed above.
6. Trace left pleural effusion and mild bilateral dependent
atelectasis.
7. Highly distended bladder. Please correlate clinically
whether the patient is able to void.

Brief Hospital Course:
2023 year old female with cervical stenosis s/p motor vehicle
collision with central cord syndrome.

#Cervical Stenosis With Spinal Cord Compression
#Central cord syndrome
The patient was taken emergently to the operating room for a
C3-C7 laminectomy and posterior fusion. The procedure was
uncomplicated. Please see separately dictated operative report
by Dr. Gregory Yates further details. A surgical drain was left
in place, which was subsequently removed on POD#5. The patient
was extubated in the operating room and recovered in the PACU.
She was transferred to the step down unit for close neurologic
monitoring. Her neurologic exam slowly improved postoperatively.
Postoperative x-rays of the cervical spine showed no evidence of
retained surgical drain or hardware complications. On 2025-07-20
overnight, the patient was noted to have worsened weakness on
exam. A CT of the cervical spine was obtained, which was grossly
negative, but there was significant artifact from the hardware.
An MRI of the cervical spine was also obtained, which showed
increased T2 signal in cord at C3-C4, but overall improvement in
the degree of spinal canal narrowing from C2-C7. Her weakness
subsequently improved and continued to improve with continued
physical and occupational therapy.

#Rib Fracture
Acute Care Surgery was consulted for fracture of the first rib
on the left. There was no surgical intervention or follow-up
needed.

#Hypoxia
The patient required supplemental oxygen on 2025-07-20. She was
subsequently weaned off the supplemental oxygen, and her oxygen
saturations remained stable on room air for the remainder of her
hospitalization.

#Right Shoulder and wrist Pain
The patient complained of significant right shoulder pain. An
x-ray of the right shoulder was obtained, which showed no
definite fracture or dislocation, however there was a well
corticated rounded density, which was thought to reflect sequela
of remote injury or calcific tendinitis. She also c/o
significant right wrist pain. An ultrasound of the right wrist
was negative. Pain medications were adjusted.

#Urinary Retention
The patient experienced urinary retention postoperatively. Her
Foley catheter was discontinued. She failed a voiding trial on
2025-07-20, and catheter was replaced. Her Foley catheter was
discontinued again on 2025-07-20, and she was able to void but
still required intermittent straight cath for retention. On
discharge patient was voiding without difficulty.

#Constipation / Ileus
She was started on an aggressive bowel regimen for constipation.
On 2025-07-20, the patient was noted to have abdominal distension.
KUB showed postop ileus. No nausea/vomiting. She was made NPO,
limited narcotics, and continued on aggressive bowel regimen.
Repeat abdominal XR 2025-07-20 showed interval improvement. On 2025-07-20,
the patient was passing her bowels and her diet was advanced to
regular. A repeat KUB showed interval improvement of the ileus.
On discharge patient was moving her bowels without difficulty.

#Fever
#UTI
The patient became febrile postoperatively. Urinalysis was
positive. Urine culture showed PROTEUS MIRABILIS UTI. She was
started on Ceftriaxone 1996.
Blood cultures were negative. Chest x-ray was negative. On
discharged there is no evidence of UTI or ongoing infection,
patient is afebrile.

#Hyponatremia
The patient was hyponatremic and was started on sodium chloride
tablets on 2025-07-20 with improvement. On 2025-07-20, the patient's
serum Na level remained low and the salt tablets were increased.
The serum Na level normalized on 2025-07-20 and the sodium was
monitored closely. On 2025-07-20, the salt tablets were titrated down
to 1g three times daily. The serum sodium continued to be
monitored, and was stable on 2025-07-20. Her sodium tablets were
weaned off and her serum sodium levels remained stable.

#Elevated BUN
The patient's BUN was elevated. She received a 500mL normal
saline bolus on 2025-07-20 with improvement. The BUN returned to
normal range on 2025-07-20. Her BUN was elevated on 2025-07-20 and
returned to normal limits the next day.

#Left shoulder pain
Patient developed severe left shoulder pain 2025-07-20. Ibuprofen was
started with some relief. XR on 2025-07-20 showed no fracture or
dislocation, but did show mild calcific tendinitis. Ibuprofen
was increased and continued 1.5:1 was recommended.

#Disposition
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy were consulted and
recommended discharge to rehabilitation. However, the patient's
health insurance does not provide any rehabilitation benefits.
Family training was done inpatient to work towards a safe
discharge. Social Work was consulted given her limited health
insurance. A family meeting was organized that resulted in the
patient's family working to get the patient insurance so
benefits can be obtained. The goal was to obtain benefits for
acute rehab at the recommendation of physical therapy, either
through the John Andrade or John Andrade. A second family meeting was held
2025-07-20 where her son, Jill Moore, was given power of attorney and
health care proxy status as the family worked on insurance.
Patient was approved for health insurance on 2025-07-20. She was
discharged on 2025-02-22 to Orthopedic Surgery Department for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Williams underwent a living related living transplant (Live
Donor Liver Transplant, right lobe graft. temporary abdominal
closure with abthera. supraceliac aortic conduit with
cryopreserved iliac artery) on 2025-08-01, he was left
open for planned biliary reconstruction the next day.
2025-04-22 he went back to the OR for ABDOMINAL
WASHOUT, INTRAOP ULTRASOUND, Roux En Y hepaticojejunostomy to
intrahepatic bile duct, staged abdominal closure. He was
recovering well and extubated when a routine ultrasound on
2025-04-07 showed hepatic artery occlusion. He was
sent to Clarkberg where they found found to have hepatic artery
thrombolysis and he underwent stent of RHA-conduit anastomosis
on 2025-02-27 and he was found to have focal active extravasation
distal to stent. He was hypotensive with multiple blood product
infusions and began have a large volume of frank blood in his
abdominal drains. He was taken emergently to the operating room
early 2025-04-18 for evacuation of hematoma; revision/replacement of
supraceliac aortic conduit to right hepatic artery. He was
extubated shortly after the procedure and initially did not
require pressors. He was pre-approved for ATG and was given 225
mg ATG total over 4 divided doses.
.
Induction Immunosuppression consisted of Solumedrol to
prednisone taper (500 mg in OR POD 0) per usual pathway.
Mycophenolate was started pre-op and was transitioned to
Myfortic on POD 18 due to GI upset with the mycophenolate. Tacro
was started on the evening of POD 1, with daily levels and dose
adjustment per level. As noted he received Thymoglobulin due to
the history of PSC.
Tacro was 11.9 on day of discharge with dosage of 2 mg BID.
.
He was recovering well on the floor when he had an acute
respiratory decompensation requiring intubation and transfer to
ICU. He had some RLL collapse on CT, no PE and was treated with
a 7 day course of vanc/cefepime He also had a right pleural
effusion that was tapped, the gram stain was negative, but the
cytology showed rare yeast. In consultation with pathology and
ID, we didnât add another fungal agent we asked for a repeat
stain and there was concern for pjp (vs artifact) in his fluid.
Again we conferred with ID and they asked us add on a fungal
culture to pleural fluid, universal PCR for PJP (sendout), BAL
add on immunoflourescence for PJP. However, his clinical picture
was inconsistent with PJP infection (despite positive beta D
glucan) and fungal coverage was not added. He also underwent
liver biopsy 2025-05-10 as his LFTs went up in the setting of some
hypotension with sedation with intubation, he underwent a
transjugular liver biopsy which showed no rejection or
autoimmune process. We placed a dobhoff and started tube feeds
after his respiratory event because he had minimal days of a
regular diet during his hospital course.
.
He was subsequently transferred to the floor. His chest tube was
removed after several days of low output; he continued to be
stable on room air. He had a persistent cough, but CXRs did not
demonstrate any consolidations. He developed nausea and had
three episodes of emesis, which displaced his feeding tube. KUB
was negative for ileus. However, He was able to tolerate a
regular diet and was placed back on his home insulin pump. He
was tolerating the regular diet well and blood sugars were
fairly well managed. He will follow up with his diabetes doctor
who helps him with the insuin pump settings.
.
Of note on the regular diet, his potassium was noted to be
increasing. He was counseled regarding the avoidance of higher
potassium foods, and will have labs checked on 2025-01-13.
.
Patient was ambulatory and was cleared by Mark Smith for home. He will
also receive OT at home. He uses splints when ambulating.

History of Present Illness:
1994 year old white male with psoriasis and long history of
alcohol abuse, depression presents to OSH on 2025-02-09 with
worsening confusion, 25 weight gain, abdominal discomfort and
anorexia over the past couple of months, found to have acute
decompensation secondary to likely alcholic hepatitis. Patient
was at usual state of health until 2025-02-26 when he presented
with worsening Device edema and was seen by PCP, started on lasix.
Subsequent f/u visits with mult providers eventually revealed on
2025-02-26 that bili was elevated to 2.9. Patient was then referred to
(GI) Dr. Connie Logan at Manipal Hospitals, who performed RUQ, found to have
cirrhosis, intiated etiology workup but not tapped. Diagnosed
patient on 2025-02-26 with cirrhosis, with negative hepatitis panel
other than Hep A IgG, negative AI, ceruloplasmin, slightly
elevated Iron:TIBC ratio. Per patient, he has been drinking
about 34 drinks on the weekends since he was 1989 years old, with
no escalation in his drinking. However per patient's brother, it
appears that he has been abusing alcohol for at least 34 years
and recently had his engagement broken off due to his heavy
drinking in Oct 2020. He was drinking about 1L wine everyday up
until 12 days ago, when patient's brother learned of cirrhosis
diagnosis and started caring for his brother on a more regular
basis. Unclear if patient has regular follow up with PCP.

Upon admission to Cleveland Health Institute, patient had no fever, n/v, but worsening
SOB. Patient's psoriasis, which for years confined to his elbows
spread across his entire body a couple of months ago. He claimed
to have tried creams in the past but does not remember taking
prednisone. He was evaluated by dermatology, who confirmed
psorasis. ED vitals at 01:27 PM: 99.4 82 117/73 100%RA. Patient
was found to have hyponatremia at 129, normal BUN and Cr, Bili

normal. INR 1.7, U/A negative for substances, infection. CXR
with mild cardiac enlargement with no evidence of PNA. KUB w
non-specific bowel gas, no free air. MELD 19. Patient started on
ceftriaxone on 2025-02-26, tapped 4L or so and abx were discontinued
once results indicated no SBP.

Upon arrival, VSS. Patient was shivering and very cold. Patient
had slight SOB while lying in bed but no CP, palpitations, or
desaturations. Abd fullness but no pain, no n/v but was burping.

Brief Hospital Course:
1994 year old white male with psoriasis and long history of
alcohol abuse, depression presents to OSH on 2025-02-09 with
worsening confusion, 25lb weight gain, increased abd girth,
abdominal discomfort and anorexia over the past couple of
months, found to have acute decompensation likely secondary to
alcholic hepatitis.

#Decompensated Liver Failure with encephalopathy and ascites:
MELD 9 upon discharge, 19 upon admission at Cleveland Health Institute. Patient's liver
failure likely Device alcoholic hepatitis HCC, Intracranial Hemorrhage, AI,
infectious causes have been ruled out. Patient's last drink was
on 2025-02-26 and is determined to abstain from drinking, has the
support of his brother. This is his first decompensation.
Patient was just told of his cirrhosis diagnosis a couple of
weeks prior to admission. RUQ US at 2025-02-26 patent portal vein,
mod ascites, no SBP (this was after ~5L was drained at OSH).
Patient remained afebrile and no antibiotics were given. Patient
was continued on rifaximin 550mg BID, lactulose (titrated to
4BM/day). There was also a question of whether or not patient
developed a rash with lasix/spirinolactone and when this was
determined to be unlikely based on skin biopsy, patient was
restarted on lasix and spirinolactone, which he tolerated (see
details below). Patient was also initiated on tube feeds as well
as thiamine, folate, MVI. EGD was normal other than portal
gastropathy, no varicies and no no h/o GIB according to patient
and brother. Given that patient's Discriminant fraction improved
dramatically during course of stay, we held off on giving him
steroids as there was concern that he could develop side effects
from psoriasis should the steroids ever be stopped.
.
#SOB: likely COVID-19 Pneumonia volume overload. CXR with pleural effusions,
likely cirrhotic hydrothorax, improved with fluid restriction
and diuresis. Patient also with h/o of 40 pk yr smoking with
scattered wheeze, initiated on albuterol prn.
.
#Hyponatremia: Patient was found to be 129 at OSH, now resolved;
NA 134, likely due to hypervolemia. Continue fluid restriction.
.
#Psoriasis: consulted derm, who recommended steroid creams,
which helped him immensely. Patient to continue these creams
daily and has outpatient follow up with prior dermatologist.
.
#Drug rash: Patient came in with red, patchy, not discrete,
itchy rash on top of his worsening psoriasis. No mucosal
involvement. Derm was c/s and biopsied site, which revealed
changes associated with psoriasis and eczema, not a drug
reaction. Patient's eos on admission were mildly elevated but
trended downwards, and stayed low despite trial of restarting
lasix, and spirinolactone. Patient will require suture removal 2
wks from 2025-02-26 by PCP on shoulder.
.
#Anemia: likely component of anemia of chronic disease as well
as macrocytic anemia from longstanding malnutrition. Started on
MVI, thiamine, folate.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Bell presented to the emergency department and was evaluated
by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found to have a
right intertrochanteric fracture and was admitted to the
orthopedic surgery service. The patient was taken to the
operating room on 2025-05-08 for right trochanteric fixation
nail, which the patient tolerated well. For full details of the
procedure please see the separately dictated operative report.
The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable
condition and after satisfactory recovery from anesthesia was
transferred to the floor. The patient was initially given IV
fluids and IV pain medications, and progressed to a regular diet
and oral medications by POD#1. The patient was given
William Jensen antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine. The
patient's home medications were continued throughout this
hospitalization. The patient worked with Care coordinator who determined that
discharge to home with home physical therapy was appropriate.
Given the patient's history of substance use disorder, the
chronic pain service was consulted and their recommendations
were implemented. The patient's discharge pain medications and
her methadone were prescribed accordingly.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is
weightbearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity, and
will be discharged on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. The patient
will follow up with Dr. Bring detailed family history records for further genetic assessment. routine. A thorough
discussion was had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and
expected post-discharge course including reasons to call the
office or return to the hospital, and all questions were
answered. The patient was also given written instructions
concerning precautionary instructions and the appropriate
follow-up care. The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

IMAGING
=======
2025-02-26 TTE
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild focal hypokinesis of
the basal to mid anteroseptum. The remaining segments contract
normally. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#5). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w LAD territory
CAD. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of 2025-03-28, wall motion abnormality is new. Left
ventricular hypertrophy is present.

2025-01-12 Cardiac Catheterization
Dominance: Right
* Left Main Coronary Artery
The LMCA is normal
* Left Anterior Descending
The LAD had subtotal occlusion just distal to prior stent and
involving a moderately small diagonal branch
which also had subtotal ostial stenosis
* Circumflex
The Circumflex has no significant disease
* Right Coronary Artery
The RCA has no significant disease.

Interventional Details
The left main was engaged with a 10 Fr Fr XBLAD 3.5 guide. The LAD
lesion was crossed with a Prowater
wire and the diagonal lesion with a BMW wire. The LAD was
dilated with a 2.0 balloon and the diagonal
with a 2.0, then 2.25 NC balloon. The LAD was then stented with
a 3.0x12 Premier Drug-eluting - Xience to 3.0
at 18 atm. There was recoil at the ostium of the branch and this
was crossed with a new BMW wire and
again dilated with the 2.25 NC balloon to 18 atm followed by
kissing balloon inflations at 8 atm Final
angiography showed no stenosis in the LAD and 30% at the ostium
of the diagonal with normal flow in
both.

Intra-procedural Complications: None
Impressions:
Successful DES of LAD and PTCA of diagonal
Continued chest pain after procedure with angiography as above
and no ischemic ECG changes.

Recommendations
Continue aspirin uninterrupted indefinitely and clopidogrel
minimum 2018 year

#UNSTABLE ANGINA: Patient presented with progressive typical
angina symptoms over that past week with exertional substernal
chest pain that was relieved by rest. Troponin I mildly
elevated at 0.01 ng/mL, troponin T negative at 0.10 ng/mL. EKG w/o ischemic
changes. He was started on heparin gtt, continued on home
aspirin, metoprol, and statin. TTE on 2025-02-26 showed LVEFF
55-60%, regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w LAD territory CAD
(new from last TTE in 2025-01-28). He underwent cardiac
catheterization that showed 99% mid LAD stenosis, now s/p DES of
LAD, and 90% of diagonal now s/p PTCA. He had some chest pain
post-procedure and mild elevation of troponins to peak of 0.33.
Chest pain resolved by the day after procedure.

# Hypertension. Stable throughout hospitalization. Continued
metoprolol, ACEI. Resumed HCTZ on discharge.

# Hyperlipidemia: continued on statin, increased simvastatin to
40 qHS post catheterization. Continued on ASA 81

# GERD: continued on omprezaole, transitioned to pantoprazole on
discharge to avoid interaction with Plavix

# Hx atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 of 1. Spontaneous conversion to
sinus in the past. Previously on ASA 325, now downtitrated to 81
ASA per last clinic note.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- Started on Plavix. Will need to remain on x 12 months or per
his outpatient cardiologist
- Simvastatin increased to 40 mg qHS. Please recheck LFTs as
patient reports prior LFT elevation on atorvastatin
- Omeprazole switched to pantoprazole to avoid possible
interaction with plavis

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Miller,

It was a pleasure caring for you at Narayana Health. You were admitted for
chest pain. A cardiac catheterization was performed that showed
a blockage of one of the arteries of your hearts and a stent was
placed. You were started on Plavix and your anticholesterol
medication was increased. Do not stop the aspirin or Plavix
without talking to your cardiologist. This could be very
dangerous!

Please also slowly reintroduce cardiovascular exercise after two
weeks rest. You may also benefit from cardiac rehabilitation.
Please also do not resume karate until discussion with your
cardiologist.

Please follow up with your primary care physician and continue
your home medications

Wishing you well,

Your Duke University Hospital Cardiology Team

**FINAL REPORT 2025-02-13

C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final 2025-03-08):
Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA
amplification assay.
(Reference Range-Negative).

Brief Hospital Course:
1977 M with HCV cirrhosis/HCC s/p TACE with stable MRI and in good
health presented for potential liver transplant. The donor was
an ABO compatible 1976 woman brain dead donor considered
CDC high risk due to social history. Patient was aware of this
high risk and agreed to proceed with donor offer. On 2025-02-21, he
underwent deceased donor liver transplant using piggyback
technique. Surgeon was Dr. David Miller assisted by Dr. Reginald Turner
Samantha Miller. Please refer to operative report for details. He was
transferred to the SICU postop for management.

He was extubated the next day. Liver enzymes increased as
expected. Liver duplex showed patent vasculature and no ductal
dilatation. He was started on a clear liquid diet. Glucoses were
elevated initially due to the steroid protocol. An insulin drip
was used with improvement. Prograf was started.

He was transferred out of the SICU. On 2025-06-17, JP output was
sanguinous. HCT was 27 from 30 and previously 33. He was given
PRBC without increase in HCT. Serial HCTs were checked. JP
output continued to be sanguinous with total daily output
1230cc. He received a total of 4 units of PRBC and 2 platelets.
HCT stabilized at 30, however, JP output continued to be ~
400-500cc/day. The JP was removed on day of discharge and site
sutured. Just prior to removal, output was 85cc x12 hours and
serous. LFTs decreased daily.

On 2025-05-03, he experienced an episode of lightheadedness while
having BM. EKG was normal. Cardiac enzymes were sent with trops
0.19->0.11->0.03. Daily ASA 81 and Atorvastatin was started.
Cardiology recommended a TTE that normal with EF of 65%. a
nuclear stress test was then done to evaluate. This showed no
ischemic changes or anginal type symptoms or ST segment changes.

Diet was advanced to regular and was well tolerated. Obstetrics and Gynecology was
consulted for mild hyperglycemia, but he did not require insulin
and the sliding scale was stopped. He was having BMs and in fact
developed diarrhea. Stool was sent for C. diff that was
negative. Imodium was given as he was C.diff negative with
decreased BMs to 2 per day.

Obstetrics and Gynecology evaluated and felt that he was safe for home.

He did very well with medication teaching. Immunosuppression
consisted of Cellcept 1 gram bid (later changed to 500mg qid),
Solu-Medrol tapered to prednisone 20 by postop day 6 and
tacrolimus. Tacrolimus doses were adjusted per daily trough
levels to 3mg bid. All medications were to be filled by
CureWell Pharmacy with coverage from Dr. Neha Gupta (Gynecologist) as requested by
patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient initially admitted to the medicine service, transferred
to neurology service on 2025-02-17.

Migraine headache: Headache was a typical migraine for her.
She was initiated on a dilaudid PCA. Brittany Gonzales initiated
methylprednisolone 1g IV x3 days. She had significant
improvement in her headache by the next morning. Dilaudid PCA
was gradually weaned down then transitioned to po dilaudid. She
received toradol 15mg IV Q8hrs x3 days. Zofran, phenergan, and
compazine used for nausea. For prophylaxis, topamax was
decreased to 25mg po qday due to side effects on higher dose.
We will plan to gradulaly incrase topamax to goal of 50mg po bid
as outpatient. In the meantime, tizanidine increased to
2mg/2mg/4mg to help with headache prophylaxis. Pain team
followed her during admission, and they were in touch with
primary pain physician Scott Leonard.

Head CT showed mild assymetry of lateral ventricles, otherwise
negative. Given headaches at times worse with lying down and
wake her at night, there was some concern for increased ICP
despite normal head CT. Patient expressed understanding of
concerns, but refused a lumbar puncture.

previous tracing of 2025-01-12 atrial ectopy, bigeminy and overall
tachycardia are new. Computed QRS duration is wider.
Non-specific repolarization abnormalities are similar on the
non-aberrantly conducted beats.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Hamilton is a 1986 female with recurrent ventral hernias at
prior incision sites who was admitted to ICU after OR repair for
decreased urine output. Below is her ICU course.
.
#Oliguria- Most likely this is due to hypovolemia in the setting
of a prolonged operative case with a significant amount of
incensible fluid loss. Her FeNa on admission is 0.03% suggesting
a pre-renal etiology. She was given continued boluses of LR
while in the unit and her UOP increased appropriately. At time
of discharge from the unit she was making over 50cc/hr of urine.

.
#Post Op Pain- Pt initially had an epidural catheter in place
for pain control infusing dilaudid and bupivacaine. Acute pain
service followed her and assisted with management. She initially
was complaining of pain and she was given a bolus of dilaudid in
her epidural catheter but this was not helping. At this point,
the epidural was kept in place with bupivacaine only infusing
and patient was started on a dilaudid PCA for overnight. The
following day her epidural catheter was removed and her dilaudid
PCA was discontinued due to new onset of delerium/paranoia.
Pain control was switched to PO medications and patient was
restarted on many of her home pain medications.
.
#Delerium-Thought to be related to anesthesia, IV pain
medications and ICU admission. Treated conservatively with
Psych consult and discontinuation of IV pain medications and
epidural. Her sister was asked to come to the ICU and remained
at patient's bedside throughout the day on POD#1 to provide
emotional support and a sense of safety to patient. Patient
showed gradual improvement with supportive measures and returned
to her baseline.
.
# S/P hernia repair- Surgical incision site was clean without
evidence of infection. 4 JP drains were in place draining a
bloody serous fluid. Gen surg and Plastic surg following along
for assistance in post op management. She was tolerating a clear
liquid diet prior to discharge from the unit. Her Hct remained
stable. We continued Ancef per surgery recs.
.
#Hypothyroidism- continued levothyroxine.
.
#Prophylaxis- Patient was maintained on heparin subcutaneous and
then lovenox injections during her hospital stay. She was
assisted out of bed to chair and assisted to ambulate as soon as
she was able.
.
By post-operative day #3, patient showed clear clinical
improvement and was transferred to the floor. She was noted to
have some tachycardia and elevated blood pressures so was
started on low dose hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg qd) on 2025-07-27
which she tolerated well. By post-operative day #5, patient was
alert and oriented and back to baseline mental status. She was
voiding large amounts of urine freely. She was able to walk
around unassisted and walk up stairs. Her abdominal incision
was clean and intact without evidence of infection. JP drains x
4 were draining serous fluid. Her abdominal binder was in place
and her pain was well controlled on her discharge pain
medication regimen. Patient was discharged home on POD#5 per
discharge plan.

DRAIN DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS
You are being discharged with drains in place. Drain care is a
clean procedure. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm
water before performing drain care. Perform drainage care twice
a day. Try to empty the drain at the same time each day. Pull
the stopper out of the drainage bottle and empty the drainage
fluid into the measuring cup. Record the amount of drainage
fluid on the record sheet. Reestablish drain suction.
.
ISSUES TO DISCUSS WITH YOUR PCP:
-Can you were hospitalized, a thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH) level was drawn to monitor thyroid function. Your level
was slightly low at 0.23. You have been maintained on your home
dose of levothyroxine (100mcg). Your PCP Can need to further
monitor your TSH level.
-You had some elevated heart rates and elevated blood pressures
while you were an inpatient. Your resting heart rate had
improved by time of discharge to 80-95. Your blood pressure
remained elevated so you were maintained on a low dose of
hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg daily). You have been given a
prescription for 30 days of this medication after which time
your PCP may decide to renew or increase this medication or
discontinue it.
-Please bring your daily vital signs log/report from the
visiting nurse to your appointment with your PCP.
-You were not maintained on your lidoderm patches or your
neurontin while in hospital. These may not be necessary any
longer given that your hernia was repaired. You should discuss
this with your PCP.

Final Report One view. Comparison with the previous study done 2025-04-21. A right chest tube  been removed. There is increased
streaky density in the right lung likely representing
subsegmental atelectasis and interval increase in a
re-distribution of a small right effusion. There is streaky
density at the left base most consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis. Mediastinal structures are unchanged. An
endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and Swan-Ganz line have
been withdrawn.
IMPRESSION: Increased streaky density on the right likely
representing
subsegmental atelectasis. Interval increase in or
re-distribution of small
right effusion.

the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Results were personally reviewed with the MD caring for the
patient.
Conclusions
Pre CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler,
echodense material seen at likely site of prior ASD repair.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of mitral valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Two
eccentric jets of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation are seen. The
posteriorly directed jet originates from a prolapsing A2 leaflet
and exhibits coanda effect. The anteriorly directed jet
originates from the base of the anterior leaflet and is
suspicious for a perforated leaflet (or failure of prior repair)
Dr. Katherine Moore was notified in person of the results.
Post CPB:
The cardiac output is 4L/min on a phenylephrine infusion and
A-paced.
There is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral
position with a centrally located trace MR jet; the mean
gradient across this valve is 3mmHg.
There is no aortic insufficiency.
The RV systolic function is preserved. The LVEF is 45-50%.
The visible contours of the thoracic aorta are intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on 2025-04-03
where the patient underwent a redo sternotomy and attempted
repair of mitral regurgitation. Please see operative report for
details, in summary the patient had: 1. Redo sternotomy.
2. Attempted repair of mitral regurgitation. 3. Mitral valve
replacement with a 31-mm Medtronic tissue valve, model
Carpentier-Edwards 25 mm.
His bypass time was 119 minutes with a crossclamp of 102
minutes. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring in stable
condition.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and breathing
comfortably.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta
blocker therapy was held secondary to post-operative juctional
rhythm which recovered to a normal sinus rhythm. The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor on POD3 for further
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
according to cardiac surgery protocol. The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility. At the time of discharge on POD #6 the
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged
to a friend's home with visiting nurses. They is to follow up with
Dr Schedule imaging after 1 month to evaluate treatment progress. in 3 weeks.

Chief Complaint:
worsened symptoms of leg weakness and freezing that made walking
difficult

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Arthur Lee is a 1978 yo M with a history of parkinsonism, b/l
vestibulopathy, lacunar strokes, TIAs, distal sensory
neuropathy, and dermatomyositis 121 years ago (off
immunosuppression) who presents with difficulty ambulating.

Mr. Arthur Lee states that he has relatively constant tingling and
vibrating sensation in bilateral legs that is hard to ignore.
This is not painful, but is extremely distracting. It affects
his legs from the inguinal level down to the toes. He walks with
a cane for the past few months that his outpatient Cardiology Outpatient Service
recommended.
For the past 2 days he has had worsened sensation in his feet
such that he does not know what his feet are doing. He had
difficulty initiating steps and felt that he was frozen or
paralyzed. He is worried about this because he states that he
was ""quadriplegic"" when he had dermatomyositis a couple of
decades ago. At baseline, he walks with a cane and drives
himself around. He has not had falls at home.
He had a scheduled appointment with his outpatient neurologist
Dr. Jesse Hernandez for lumbar CT (can't get MRI due to pacemaker)
to evaluate for spinal column instability, but he felt unsafe to
drive given poor pedal sensation. After discussion with the
clinic nurse, he was referred into the Cardiology Clinic for further
evaluation. Patient reports discussion with his primary
neurologist, Dr. Jesse Hernandez noted that symptoms of inability to
move Head were likely not due to neuropathy, he was referred to
Neurology for further evaluation.
Despite this history of inability to move his legs, he has
been walking yesterday and with the neurology and Nephrology consults
that saw him in the past 24 hrs.
In the ER, lumbar CT did not show significant spinal
stenosis. Labs were normal, including CK, making myopathy
unlikely. Neurology was consulted in the ER and the patient was
able to walk and displayed 5- to 5 strength throughout.
He was admitted for Chest pain for evaluation of possible myocardial infarction and medical evaluation. Of note from
the ED exam, he had initial inability to clench anal sphincter
on examiner's hand, but subsequently had strong anal tone.

Today he states he's anxious about becoming paralyzed. He has
constant tingling of both legs that requires his full attention
to deal with other stimuli such as conversation.

He has no word-finding difficulty, visual change, headache,
dysarthria, fevers, chills, neck pain, cough, rash, muscle pain.

IMAGING
-------
2025-08-02 EKG: Baseline artifact marring interpretation of rhythm but
probable sinus rhythm. Delayed R wave transition. Non-specific
ST segment changes. Non-diagnostic Q waves in the high lateral
leads. No previous tracing available for comparison.

2025-03-14 LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER US:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the visualized
bilateral lower
extremity veins. Peroneal veins were not identified.

2025-03-27 CT OF THE LUMBAR SPINE:
IMPRESSION:
1. Study is limited secondary to patient body habitus.
2. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment.
3. No definite bony spinal canal stenosis. If concern for non
bony vertebral canal stenosis, consider lumbar spine MRI or CT
myelogram for further evaluation.
4. Grossly stable multilevel degenerative changes as described.

Brief Hospital Course:
1978 year old man with history of Parkinsonism, bilateral
vestibulopathy, lacunar strokes, spinal stenosis of the lumbar
spine, B12 deficiency, and distal sensory neuropathy who
presents with subacute worsening of leg dysesthesias and sensory
deficits over a few days.

# Distal sensory neuropathy/Gait instability: Presented with
difficulty ambulating. He had a scheduled appointment with his
outpatient neurologist Dr. Jesse Hernandez for lumbar CT (can't get
MRI due to pacemaker) to evaluate for spinal column instability,
but he felt unsafe to drive given poor pedal sensation. After
discussion with the clinic nurse, he was referred into the Cardiology Clinic Cardiology Clinic for further evaluation. Patient reports discussion with
his primary neurologist, Dr. Jesse Hernandez noted that symptoms of
inability to move Head were likely not due to neuropathy, he was
referred to Neurology for further evaluation. In the ER, lumbar CT
did not show significant spinal stenosis. Labs were normal,
including CK, making myopathy unlikely. Neurology was consulted
in the ER and the patient was able to walk and displayed 5- to 5
strength throughout. He was admitted for Chest pain for evaluation of possible myocardial infarction.
On exam he has at least 4+/5 strength in his lower
extremities, though he appears to be unsteady on his feet with
both forward and backward instability. This occurred with During exercise as
well. His strength does not appear to be affected, though his
difficulty initiating movements may in part be due to
Parkinsonism, though he does not appear bradykinetic. He did not
want to increase gabapentin because it has made him somnolent in
the past. Furthermore, he does not have nystagmus, dysmetria on
exam to suggest vestibular or cerebellar problem with movement.
His last B12 was 295 (normal) in Dec 2025. Per neuro, no evidence
of spinal cord localization on their exam and no evidence of
myopathy based on normal CK.
Nephrology recommended rehab, but the patient did not want to go, so
we planned to send him home with a rolling walker and home Visiting nurse.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Arthur Lee, you were admitted because of worsened symptoms of
leg weakness and freezing that made walking difficult. On
evaluation by the neurology service, you were felt to have some
possible worsening of your known peripheral neuropathy. A CT of
the low back did not show any new abnormality. There was no
evidence of dysfunction in the spinal cord to suggest a risk for
new worsened neurologic function. You were seen by the physical
therapists who recommended rehab, but you preferred to go home.
Therefore, we discharged you home with a rolling walker. You
will have a clinic follow up with Dr. Susan Jackson to discuss possible
new treatments for your neuropathy.

We wish you the best,
Your Cardiology team

Followup Instructions:
Increase daily walking gradually as tolerated."

Chief Complaint:
right hip and knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF right femur 2025-08-04

History of Present Illness:
1993 woman with history of multiple sclerosis and frequent UTIs
here for right hip fracture with post ORIF course complicated by
urinary tract infection and delerium. She fell 10d prior to
admission while ""pushing a chair"" according to family she also
had significant head strike but not LOC. She had plain films of
the knee that showed no fracture, and negative head CT per
report on day of fall, but continued to have knee pain and was
unable to ambulate 4/10 (moderate) pain for 10d (uses walker at baseline) so
went to Urology Clinic where CT of the leg showed medial femoral
condyle frature and medial patellar fracture. So she was
transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital for right ORIF which she underwent 2025-08-04.

Post op course complicated by waxing and waning mental status,
UA showed UTI for which she was started on ciprofloxacin
2025-05-23, urine culture showed no growth. She has continued to
have a dirty UA, also having intermittent urinary retention
requiring sterile straight catheterization, and mental status
appears to be worsening instead of improving, now with visual
hallucinations/delusions, thinking there is a birthday party in
her room, for example. Neuro was consulted, they do not feel
this is related to her multiple sclerosis. Ortho has requested
transfer to medicine for further management. Low grade fevers to
100.0F yesterday, mild leukocytosis to 12, blood and repeat
urine cultures pending.
At time of transfer vital signs were: 98.7 119/62 80 16 100%.
Johnson is oriented to person, place, month and day, but thinks
it is 07:47 AM. Family (son and husband) at bedside report
that Johnson has had increasing confusion since the day of her
fall, but has become more acutely worse over the past few days.
They report she has frequent UTIs, usually at North Deanna, sees
urologist Dr. Lisa Keith.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, acute major vascular territorial infarction, or
pathologic extraaxial collection. The ventricles and sulci are
prominent, as before, consistent with cerebral atrophy.
There are extensive subcortical, deep and periventricular white matter
hypodensities, grossly unchanged, and likely related to the
known multiple sclerosis, plus/minus superimposed chronic small
vessel ischemic disease. No fracture is seen. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process. No change
since 2025-03-07.

CXR 2025-01-26
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to 2025-02-01. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinum is

following a fall 2 weeks prior, post-operative course
complicated by delerium and urinary tract infection.

# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Johnson had increasing
confusion since about the time of her fall most likely due to
urinary tract infection as discussed below, which acutely
worsened following surgery. Neurology was initially consulted by
orthopedics out of concern that her mental status changes were
reflective of a multiple sclerosis flare but this was not felt
to be the case. Neurology felt this was most consistent with
delirium. Medication effect possibly played a role. Narcotics
were minimized, zolpidem was discontinued and UTI was treated as
below. Repeat CT head on 2025-03-13 was negative for acute
intracranial process, showed stable atrophy and white matter
lesions consistent with known MS. Johnson improved gradually,
Neurology evaluated day before discharge and thought she was at
baseline, full clear and signed off, comfortable she had
improved to baseline. Johnson was interviewed with her family at
bedside on day of discharge. Family felt she was at baseline
mental status per discharge physical exam neurologic evaluation
above.

# E. coli urinary tract infection: Johnson presented after a
fall which may have been first sign of infection, gradually
worsening altered mental status leading up to hospitalization as
discussed above. Low grade fevers, leukocytosis and positive UA
consistent with urinary tract infection in Johnson with history
of neurogenic bladder. Did not improve with 5 days of
ciprofloxacin so was transferred to medicine and improved on
ceftriaxone. Required intermittent catheterization and foley
placement for urinary retention, chronic urinary retentin and
recurrent UTIs from neurogenic bladder Direct multiple sclerosis.
Urine cultre grew E. coli though sensitivities pending on
discharge. A 10 day antibiotic course for complicated UTI with
Cefpodoxime will complete 2025-06-02.

# Leukocytosis: Initially most likely stress response from
recent fracture but also component of urinary tract infection
given delerium and low grade temperatures while on standing
acetaminophen (to 100.0F). UTI treated as above. Chest xray was
negative for pneumonia. Final blood cultures pending at
discharge.

# Right femur fracture: S/p ORIF on 2025-01-25, transferred to
medicine from orthopedic surgery service for urinary tract
infection and altered mental status as above. 40mg daily
enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis (does not need full dose
anticoagulation as was long bone, not hip). Discharged to rehab
for further physical therapy. Pain treated with standing and prn
acetaminophen and low dose oxycodone to avoid further clouding
mental status.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Post-operative anemia due to blood loss - POD 3 Hct 23.6 ->
Transfused 1 unit PRBCs due to episodic hypotension despite IV
fluids.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1. The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1. The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well. The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
tolerated on the operative extremity.

2. Urinary retention
A foley catheter was placd pre-op and was dc'ed POD 2 at 6am.
Patient failed
voiding trial so foley was replaced POD 2 evening for urinary
retention. Foley catheter is to be discontinued tomorrow, on
2025-05-25 at the South Aaron center
and a voiding trial should be repeated at 05:11 AM.

Ms Thompson is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

EGD report:
NL Esophagus/Duodenum
Petechiae, erythema, and friable antrum in the stomach
compatible with GAVE

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted for fluid overload and evaluation of acute
blood loss anemia. He had one heme positive stool, and was
transfused for hct of 24 which bumped appropriately to 27.
Initially Coumdin was continued for purpose of his mechanical
valve and chronic afib. PPI was increased to BID. Patient was
diuresed and his creatinine remained stable at 1.3. He had a
positive UTI and was placed on ABX. His hematocrit continued to
trend downward. GI was consulted. Per GI: anticoagulation with
Coumadin was held. 2025-04-02 INR was allowed to drift down so
that GI could perform an EGD. He was transfused packed red blood
cells for HgB </= 7. On 2025-03-09 GI performed an EGD. In the
stomach antrum a bleeder was cauterized. Heparin drip was
restarted for anticoagulation to bridge until INR therapeutic on
Coumadin. After the course of ABX was completed, a repeat urine
was obtained and the CX resulted negative. Physical Therapy was
consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
Per GI prior to discharge, If hematocrit continues to drop they
will intervene - otherwise follow-up as outpatient (appointment
scheduled.) As an outpatient, GI recommends check HCT with INR
10 times per week initially for the first few weeks after
discharge. They believe he may need periodic outpatient
transfusions/iron supplements. By the time of HD#14 he was
cleared for discharge to home. INR was therapeutic for goal
2.5-3.5 with mechanical AVR/MVR and atrial fibrillation.
Anticoagulation to be followed by Return to the emergency room immediately if fever exceeds 101Â°F.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Early Ileus- He developed abdominal distention and discomfort
on the evening of POD#2. He was placed on clears and IVF and
his symptoms improved. He had a BM on POD#4 and his diet was
advanced to regular.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1. The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1. The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well. The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions.

Mr Hodge is discharged 07:28 PM in stable condition.

Imaging/Studies:
=================
Liver/Gallbladder US 2025-06-12:
1. Gallbladder distention with sludge and stones with possible
suggestion ofmild wall edema. The sonographic Dana Reid sign is
negative. Recommend clinical correlation for acute
cholecystitis. HIDA can be obtained if clinically warranted.

ERCP 2025-02-18:
A large, buldging and congestion of the major papilla was
noted. Concerning for ampullary malignancy
A single shelf-like stricture of malignant appearance that
was 8 mm long was seen at the lower third of the common bile
duct and in the intraampullary area.
There was moderate post-obstructive dilation.
No filling defects were noted.
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush
in the lower third of the common bile duct
A 7 Fr FR X 6 cm biliary plastic stent was placed.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the
major papilla .
Post stent placement good drainage of contrast and bile were
noted.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

MRCP 2025-06-06:
1. Small amount of expected postprocedural pneumobilia. Mildly
dilated
common bile duct, measuring up to 8 mm. Stent within the distal
common bile duct. No abnormal enhancement, mass lesion or
filling defect within the biliary tree or in the region of the
ampulla.

2. 7 mm cystic lesion in the pancreatic head. Follow-up MRCP
in 18 year is
recommended.

EGD/EUS 2025-06-19:
The previously placed stent was found in the ampulla.
There was evidence of blood oozing around the stent.
This was irrigated and the source, likely from the previous
biopsy site, was identified.
This was treated with injection of 8 cc of 1:10,000
epinephrine and gold probe cautery with good effect.
There was no evidence of residual bleeding post-gold probe
application.

CXR 2025-07-10:
New small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Left basilar atelectasis. Vague right juxta hilar opacity which
could reflect aspiration or focal pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting.

TTE 2025-02-28:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10 mmHg mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
A single tilting disk type aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
1990 man with h/o rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical AVR,
ventricular wall aneurysm, L MCA/accom/basilar aneurysm s/p
coiling, BPH and Fracture of left arm in 2012, treated with casting transferred
from OSH with clostridium perfringens bacteremia including cholangitis
now s/p stent placement found to have ampullary mass now with
course complicated by worsening anemia and peripheral edema.

# Sepsis due to cholangitis with clostridium perfringens
bactermia: Patient was found to have Clostridium perfringens
bacteremia at OSH felt to be due to cholangitis. For concern for
cholangitis, patient underwent an ERCP with stent placement on
2025-04-02 with improvement in his LFTs and bilirubin following his
procedure. On ERCP, he was found to have an ampullary mass from
which biopsies and brushings were taken (see below). His
coumadin was restarted with heparin bridge following his
procedure. His bacteremia was initially managed with zosyn and
he was transitioned to ceftriaxone and flagyl with the
assistance of ID to complete a total of 14 days from 2025-08-12 (day
of ERCP). A PICC was placed prior to discharge. He will need his
PICC removed with his PCP after completion of his IV antibiotics
on 2025-06-22.

#Anemia: Patient had worsening anemia throughout admission with
recent hemoglobin around 10, trending down to mid-7s. Work-up
was notable for low haptoglobin suggesting hemolysis. Hematology
was consulted and reviewed his smear which did not show
significant number of schistocytes. Review of previous labs
showed low haptoglobin in the past. G6PD negative, repeat blood
cultures without evidence of recurrent bacteremia (clostridium
perfringens can cause hemolysis). Urine hemosiderin ultimately
was positive suggesting chronic intravascular hemolysis, likely
secondary to his mechanical aortic valve. Patient was also found
to have black, guaiac positive stools. He went for repeat EUS
and EGD which showed bleeding from the ampullary mass which was
cauterized. Following this procedure, the patient's hemoglobin
stabilized. He was started on IV PPI BID and transitioned to
pantoprazole 40mg PO BID which he will continue for 4 weeks. He
was also started on folic acid in setting of malnutrition and
hemolysis.

#Ampullary mass: Found on ERCP in setting of cholangitis. CEA
normal, CA CEA elevated. Ampulla cytology and path negative for
malignancy however per repeat EUS on 2025-07-31, still with concerning
mass that will likely need repeat biopsy. Patient is to be
reviewed in multidisciplinary pancreatico-biliary conference and
will follow-up with Dr. John Woods in Green Valley Hospital clinic on
2025-03-30 for further evaluation.


# Mechanical AVR Congestive Heart Failure rheumatic heart disease
# Supratherapeutic INR - INR 5.5 on admission, per pt has goal
of 2.5 â 3.5 (Mechanical prosthetic heart valve). Old style Bjork-Shiley valve placed in the 1970s.
Cardiology consulted and assisted with plans to reverse Coumadin
for his ERCP. He was placed on heparin drip once INR was <2.5.
Warfarin was restarted following ERCP and heparin gtt used to
bridge while in hospital. Patient was discharged on lovenox 80mg
BID until INR >3.0. Metoprolol restarted at discharge.

#Volume overload: Patient with significant volume overload
following fluid resuscitation for sepsis. He had significant
peripheral edema, bilateral pleural effusions and mild PND. He
was diuresed with 20mg IV lasix BID with improvement in his
symptoms. Repeat TTE showed EF 65% and was largely unchanged
from prior at New Barry in 2025-03-17. Weight at baseline at time of
discharge.

#Nausea, malnutrition: Patient with moderate malnutrition noted
during admission with poor PO intake in setting of nausea. His
antiemetics were increased with improved symptoms and improved
PO intake. Will need to consider nutrition vs GI consult as
outpatient if symptoms persist.


# Basilar aneurysm s/p coil assisted w stent performed by Dr.
John Woods on 2025-05-05 (hospitalized 3 days. He should remain on
current dose of aspirin. There is elevated risk of stroke if he
ever stops aspirin at this time.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Valdez,

You were admitted to Brigham and Womenâs Hospital with jaundice and a blood stream
infection due to an infection in your biliary system. You
underwent an ERCP which showed a mass in your biliary system (in
the ampulla where bile drains). The mass was biopsied and you
will need to follow-up with the pancreatic surgeons to discuss
the next steps for management of the mass.

In terms of your infection, you were seen by the infectious
disease team and started on two antibiotics, ceftriaxone and
flagyl which you will continue to take through 2025-08-17.
Ceftriaxone will be given via your PICC line. You will need to
arrange for follow-up with your PCP following completion of your
antibiotics for removal of the PICC line.

Unfortunately, while you were here, you experienced worsening
anemia (low blood counts). You were found to have some mild
breakdown of your blood, likely from your mechanical aortic
valve. You were also found to have bleeding from your GI tract
and a repeat endoscopy showed bleeding from the site of your
ampulla biopsy. This was treated and your blood counts
stabilized. You will need to continue to take pantoprazole twice
daily for the next four weeks for treatment of this bleed.

Finally, in terms of your mechanical aortic valve, your coumadin
was held initially and restarted after your procedure on 2025-01-09.
You will need to go home with lovenox until your INR is above
3.0. You will need to have your INR checked at Jamietown
Nephrology on 2025-08-16 at 8:30AM.

Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed.

It was a pleasure taking Adjust as needed of you,
Your Nephrology Cardiology Team

History of Present Illness:
Brittany Brock with dementia, HTN, Aflutter and known SCC of the right
mastoid/parotid who presents from her SNF with AMS and weakness.

Pt was recently admitted to Apollo Medical Center in Mcgeeside, South Dakota with failure to
thrive. No specific cause was found for her symptoms and she
improved with IVF. She was discharged to a SNF given that her
family was no longer able to care for her at home. She was also
noted to have a cystic mass in the right parotid/mastoid area
and was briefly treated with antibiotics given concern for
infection, however cultures of the aspirated fluid were
negative. Cytology from this aspiration was positive for
malignant cells, consistent with SCC. After discussion with the
family, the decision was made not to pursue any further
treatment for the mass.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.8 98 105/55 18 100%. Labs were
notable for: Na 151, Cl 116, BUN 45, Cr 1.2; WBC 8.7 with 74%
PMNs; lactate 2.2; UA without evidence of infection. CT orbits
preliminarily showed an increase in the size of a known left
mastoid/parotid mass (squamous cell malignancy) with internal
air and increased cystic component concerning for superinfection
(cystic/necrotic elements). She received vancomycin and Zosyn in
the ED. VS prior to transfer: 98.0 91 40 bpm (severe bradycardia) 26 100%.
Per SNF, pt has been having a marked decline recently. Not
taking POs and requiring IVF there. They were also concerned
about infection given drainage from the right ear in area of SCC
mass, started on CTX 1g daily on 2025-01-10. Per their records, pt
is full code and they have been unable to reach the pt's family
regarding these changes in her clinical status.
On arrival to the floor, patient opens eyes to commands and
points at mouth repeatedly. Unable to answer any questions,
speaks but is largely incomprehensible. Recent baseline mental
status is not entirely clear right now, her son Thomas Fernandez is
currently also in the hospital and is unavailable at this time.
Per the patient's daughter-in-law, the patient is usually awake
and will answer simple questions, usually recognizes her son and
intermittently recognized other family members.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Goals of care: The son who is HCP was contacted and determined
that the patient is to be made DNR/DNI and CMO. All labs were
stopped, Abx stopped, and started on prn oral morphine. It was
also agreed with the son that she is not to be rehospitalized.

#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Likely multifactorial. She has
had very poor PO intake recently and hypernatremic at admission.
There is also concern for infection of her known SCC which has
been draining pus recently and this is likely affecting her
mental status. No evidence of UTI or PNA. She is now CMO- no
Abx.

#Aflutter: Rate control not ideal given HR in the low 100s.
Unable to take PO at this time, not anticoagulated prior to
admission. Lateral TWIs and ST depressions may be rate-related.
Tele was dc'd due to CMO, cont with carvedilol as she may be
more comfortable with RVR suppression.

#Head/neck SCC and concern for infection: There is frank pus
draining from the ear canal in the area of the known Santoschester mass,
air fluid level on CT concerning for infection. No further
workup since patient is CMO.

#Hypernatremia: Free water deficit is 1.8L, IVF stopped due to
CMO.

Dear Ms. Patrick,

It was a pleasure participating in your care at Apollo Medical Center
Darlenestad.

You were admitted with concern about the mass in your ear. We
met with your son, who is your health care proxy, and it was
determined that the best course is to focus on your comfort
rather than attempt to treat the mass.

You are being discharged back to your nursing home with medicine
to control your pain and anxiety.

It has been determined that you will not return to the hospital
if you continue to feel worse.

ULTRASOUND UPPER EXT:
FINDINGS: Focused sonographic evaluation was performed of the
right subclavian
vein demonstrating an unchanged linear echogenic structure
comprised of two
parallel echogenic tracts within the lumen of the subclavian
vein. While there
is no correlate on chest radiograph, it remains concerning for
catheter
fragment given the appearance of these two parallel tracts and
relatively
rigid appearance on real-time imaging.

IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for retained catheter fragment
in the right
subclavian vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Moore is a 1978 with DM, ESRD on HD, and past h/o GPC
bacteremia who presented after febrile and hypotensive episode
at outpatient HD center one day prior to admission, and was
found to have MRSA septicemia.

#MRSA Septicemia: Patient arrived from OSH after having received
empiric vanc/gent. She remained febrile and was placed on
empiric vanc/cefepime for MRSA and GNR coverage, but was
eventually narrowed to vanc monotherapy after blood culture grew
MRSA. Patient was hypotensive at several points of her stay,
and was resuscitated with IV NS with good effect. She denied any
symptoms during these episodes. Home metoprolol was held, given
sepsis physiology. HD catheter was the presumed source of
infection and pulled. CXR did not exclude pneumonia, although
patient did not appear to have respiratory symptoms. TTE did not
reveal signs of valvular vegetations or pacemaker lead
infection; however, patient was not amenable to a TEE. Patient
had mild R hand and arm swelling and u/s revealed possible
retained subclavian line fragment. CXR did not show evidence of
line fragment. Repeat u/s read as positive for retained line
fragment. L AV fistula u/s was reassuring.

ID was consulted and recommended vancomycin trough goal of
15-20 mcg/mL. Last trough drawn showed therapeutic levels, and patient
has remained afebrile since 2025-04-20. Treatment time will be
indefinite with IV vancomycin dosed with HD.

Orthopedics was consulted for evaluation of L hip and R knee for
possible septic arthritis. Ortho thought septic arthritis
unlikely based on clinical findings with preserved ROM, and no
erythema/warmth to suggest joint pathology. Patient declined
x-ray imaging.

Given her goals of care near the end of her stay (see below),
further attempts to diagnose and treat her were declined in
total, including non-invasive removal of her possible retained
catheter. Thus, she was ultimately discharged on indefinite
vancomycin with no further invasive procedures/measures to
correct her significant infection.

#Hypotension: Initially thought to be secondary to sepsis.
Responded well to fluids, and remained clinically well. Heart
failure service consulted for further evaluation as possible
cardiac cause of hypotension. Recommendations were made for
goal-directed therapy at discretion of patient's family's and
patient's wishes. Restarted beta blocker at discharge.
Patient's blood pressure was eventually taken at lower extremity
and showed SBP in 140s.

#ESRD: Patient received HD 2025-05-06, Sa
2025-03-28, and 2025-08-04 in her routine fashion.

# Diabetic Foot Ulcer - Patient was seen by wound care team, who
asked for vascular surgery consult. Vascular surgery who
recommended no further intervention during this hospitalization.
Vascular surgery also recommended patient follow up with her
OSH vascular surgeon, Dr. Sharon Keller. Daily dressing changes were
done with Adaptic.

# Diabetes, type 2 poorly controlled with complications - Placed
on HISS and Lantus 4 units daily. Patient found to have elevated
finger sticks on several occasional, but often refused
treatment. However, no acute events.

# Syncopal arrhythmia s/p pacemaker placement - Continued
aspirin. Held metoprolol given sepsis physiology.

# HLD - continued atorvastatin 80 mg daily

# Iron deficiency - placed on ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg
iron) tablet daily

# Chronic Constipation - continued senna and Colace

# Goals of care: The patient was initially full code with no
limits to care. She was started on Vancomycin and underwent
various imaging studies. However, during her hospitalization
she was quite resistant to many aspects of her care, mostly
regarding invasive measures. During this evaluation, she
remained comfortable and denied complaints of pain. As her
hospitalization progressed, she refused even less invasive
tests, such as blood testing and vital signs. This was relayed
to the patient's family. Given these behaviors, and her overall
poor prognosis and state of debilitation, several goals of care
discussions were had with her, her family, and her outpatient
nephrologist. Understanding her comorbidities, current state of
illness, and desire not to have invasive testing or procedures,
they all ultimately decided on transitioning the patient out of
the hospital to focus on comfort/hospice care, with no further
invasive tests or treatment strategies, or escalation of care.
Even when her ultrasound identified a possible retained foreign
object, which could have been the main nidus of her infection,
and even at our recommendation to attempt removal in a
non-invasive way, the patient and family still declined,
understanding that her infection would likely continue and
progress. She was comfortable on discharge, and transitioned to
DNR/DNI and hospice care.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Moore,

You were admitted to the Riverbend Medical for fevers and low blood
pressure. You were found to have bacteria in your blood and
were treated with antibiotics, which you will continue to
receive after discharge. You also received intravenous fluids,
which helped your blood pressure. You were seen by the dialysis
service here, who continued your dialysis on your regular
schedule, using the fistula in your left arm. The hemodialysis
catheter that you came with was removed.

While you were here, we did several tests to look for the source
of your blood infection. An x-ray of your chest did not show
infection in your lungs. An echocardiogram, which is an
ultrasound of your heart, did not reveal infection in your
heart. However, It showed signs of heart failure and severe
pulmonary hypertension. Because of this, the Heart Failure Team
here saw you. They felt that this would be best managed by
medications. You should speak to your primary care physician
about how this will be managed best.

You were also seen by orthopedics to see if you had bacteria in
your left hip and right knee joints. Based on physical exam,
they were not concerned for infection in these areas. They took
fluid from your right knee. There was no infection or other
concerning findings.

You were also seen by vascular surgeons for your leg wounds.
They recommended daily dressing changes, and further outpatient
evaluation. You should follow up with your vascular surgeon,
Dr. Sharon Keller.

We performed an ultrasound the identified a retained line
fragment in your right subclavian vein. You and your HCP elected
to not invasively remove this fragment.

We stopped your metoprolol, but did not change your other home
medications, and you should continue to take these medications
as prescribed.

You should continue IV vancomycin with dialysis for the rest of
your life.

It was a pleasure caring for you!

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This is a 1997 female with a history of depression, anxiety, and
ADHD who, per OMR, had reportedly been fairly stable until
2025-02-15 when she ran out of her psychotropic medications-
Wellbutrin XL 300mg/day, Adderal 30mg extended release qAM,
2010 short acting/daily, Buspar 30mg BID, without the
knowledge of her psychiatrist. Pt reports that she subsequently
had ""a shitty spring"" which she attributed to disliking her job
and dealing with the fact that
her younger brother will have graduated from college before her.


Pt reports feeling increasingly depressed with intermittent
thoughts of overdosing on her meds. Pt reports that thoughts
became more frequent and intense. She reports that on the 2025-01-09
PTA she drank a pint of vodka (""so that I would go through with
it"") and Compazine 30mg (""so I wouldn't throw anything up"")
followed by Coumadin 200mg (""to make it easier to bleed to death
if I cut
myself."") and Xanax 2005 over a 1:1.5 hour period."" Pt
reports having little recollection of this period, and she
apparently went to work on 2025-03-18- ""I have no idea how I got to
work- I just showed up."" While at work, she told a colleague
that she made a suicide attempt- he took her to the Michaelborough
police station. She was subsequently brought to our ED via
ambulance. During the Ed evaluation, she was ""relieved"" to still
be alive but admits to being anxious wondering ""what's next?""
She was most concerned about placement and wondering whether she
will be able to keep her job.

Overall, she reported poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, poor
energy, and impaired concentration. She reported increased
frequency of panic attacks (for which she was recently
prescribed Xanax) and overall anxiety which she attributes to
unhappiness at work, particularly around her boss. She denied
symptoms consistent with mania or psychosis.

Past Psychiatric History
- no previous reported suicide attempts
- denied self-injury (although other notes allude to pt having
old scars from cutting)
- 3 previous hospitalizations for depression- two as a teenager
in 2024, and last year at General City Hospital which she describes as
""the worst experience of my life.""
- medication regimen as noted, psychiatrist is Dr. Eddie Perry at
Riverbend Chronic Care. Pt reported continuing to see Dr.
Eddie Perry after running out of meds (without telling her). Pt
reported that prescriptions ran out, and she was ""embarrassed""
to ask to have them refilled

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to inpatient psychiatry after a suicide
attempt, under a conditional voluntary basis. There were no
acute medical issues during her hospitalization. Despite the
severity of her suicide attempt, the patient appeared to be
euthymic when she presented to the psychiatry unit. She
discussed how she stopped taking her medications months earlier
and did not tell her psychiatrist, who continued to prescribe
these for her. She denied however,that she 'stockpiled' her
medications, at least consciously.

The patient had been restarted on Wellbutrin while on medicine
and this was increased during the hospital stay. She requested a
medication to help with anxiety and Topamax was chosen since she
did not want to gain weight and she had tried this in the past
for migraines with no side effects.  Her adderall was held. The
patient also complained of insomnia and Trazodone was started.
This appeared to work for her.

Throughout the hospital stay, she increasingly became concerned
that ""everyone knew"" she was in the hospital, which caused her
to be visibly upset at various times. She admitted to feeling
anxious and depressed, which gradually resolved during the
intermediate portion of her stay. The patient intermittently
expressed frustrations about her inpatient stay, and in
particular, about another patient who she perceived as verbally
aggressive. Although she felt ready to be discharged after a few
days, she was anxious about her aftercare. Her repsonsibilities
and rights as a patient were fully discussed, given her recent
history of inconsistent participation in therapy. She advocated
she did not follow up with her therapist as scheduled because he
was out of her network, and she was unable to afford the fees.
However, when given the option of establishing new providers
within her network, she declined. Moreover, she contended
finances would no longer be an issue precluding her from
attending appointments. She was scheduled to attend a partial
partial program at Reginatown the week following discharge.
Initially, she requested not to return to Michaelborough, but later
changed her mind, citing transportation ease. However, she did
not want to be placed in the women's program. She planned to
travel to Port Austinborough by train immediately after discharge to
meet her parents, spend the weekend with them at their Assisted living facility
house in the Urban area and return to her apartment in Port Austinborough
by 2025-04-13 morning. The patient denied SI throughout the course
of her hospitalization.

from record review.
CC: generalized malaise
HPI: 2019 yo Asian speaking F with PMH sig for CKD, HTN, COPD,
and distant hx of colon ca s/p R hemicolectomy in 2012 sent to
ER by neighbor who found her pale, shaking, and ill appearing at
home on the morning of admission. In the ER the patient said ""I
don't feel well"" but was unable to explain what had happened. On
arrival to the floor after some treatment initiated in the ER,
her sensorium had cleared somewhat. She reports that she had a
fall in the bathroom ~2 days ago. She is not sure how she fell,
but denies feeling light-headed, nauseous, or weak. She denies
CP, palpitations, and feeling ill in any other way on the
morning of her fall. She does not remember if she had an LOC.
She reports that she did hurt her bottom, but was able to crawl
to the couch where she remained due to pain.
.
In the following 4:1 she remained on the couch initially
because of pain and eventually because of the development of
shaking chills, fatigue, and malaise (the buttock pain has since
resolved). She says that she was so cold that her fingers and
toes felt numb. She is unable to answer as to whether or not the
heat in her apartment is on. Mrs. Vazquez says that she did
not eat or drink during those two days. She reports using ""a
device"" to use the bathroom without having to walk to the
restroom. Her neighbor visited daily to give the scheduled
medications as Ms. Vazquez was essentially couch bound.
This AM, the neighbor felt Ms. Vazquez looked very ill and
called EMS.
.
Ms. Vazquez has SOB at baseline that has not worsened
recently. She denies upper respiratory symptoms, HA, nausea,
vomiting, change in bowel and urinary output, smell, and
consistency. She has not had pain when going to the bathroom.
She has not noticed any blood in her excriment.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief the patient is a 2019 y/o female with PMH sig for CHF,
COPD, HTN, and colon CA s/p resection 1977, chronic kidney
disease presenting due general malaise and hyperkalemia s/p fall
2 days ago.

1) Generalized Malaise: The main differntial diagnosis
considered was infection vs. malnutrition vs. hyperkalemia vs.
medication mismanagement vs. worsening renal function. It was
felt most likely that she became dehydrated from poor oral
intake and chronic diarrhea which resulted in worsening renal
function and the generalized malaise. There was no evidence of
infection. She was hydrated with IVF then oral fluids. Her
renal function returned to her baseline. She had no syncope
events nor had any arrhythmias while on telemetry monitoring.
Her lisinopril was discontinued. It was felt that she would
benefit from rehab to increase endurance and conditioning.

2). Acute on Chronic Renal failure associated with hyperkalemia:
The patient presented with pre-renal azotemia associated with
hyperkalemia. There were mildly peaked T-waves on her EKG which
resolved with therapy. At discharge her renal function had
returned to her baseline after re-hydration.

3). Proph
- DVT: Hep SQ
- GI: encourage PO diet
- Cardio: ASA 81mg

4.) Dispo: The patient was discharged in stable condition to
short term rehab. A long term care plan will be re-addressed
with the patient and her primary care provider. She has declined
long term care facilities many times in the past and she is not
willing to move to New Stacey to live with her son.

History of Present Illness:
1979 year old man PMH ESRD on HD (MWF), HFpEF, DM, pHTN who
presented to Port Jessica from dialysis with acute shortness of
breath, hypertensive urgency, found to have flash pulmonary
edema and influenza B.

Mr. Anderson reports that about 5:1 hours ago he started to
experience a terrible cough with associated mid-sternal pain,
malaise, feeling feverish and body aches. Cough is
non-productive without sputum. He received influenza vaccine
this year. Only chest pain has been sternal with cough,
non-pleuritic, non-exertional, one day only. He has not had any
unilateral leg edema, nor no history of malignancy nor clot. He
makes 2000 mL/day soda can of urine daily with torsemide 60mg daily. He
has not had any recent dietary indiscretions (""I don't believe
that label when it says low sodium chicken broth"").

At 06:29 PM, he was placed on BiPAP, nitroglycerin drip. He was
found to be influenza B positive and was also started on
linezolid (given vancomycin allergy) and Zosyn. He was
med-flighted to Masonton. Prior to med-flight attempted to wean
BiPAP which failed.

IMAGING
=============================
2025-01-06: PHARM STRESS TEST: Enlarged left ventricular cavity
with end-diastolic volume of 178 mL. Left ventricular ejection
fraction is 52%. No reversible perfusion defect.

2025-01-06 TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Doppler evidence of elevated fillling
pressures. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

CXR 2025-01-06: 1. Worsening bilateral pulmonary edema when
compared to most recent prior chest radiograph performed earlier
today.
2. Increased obscuration of the right heart border and left
hemidiaphragm could be secondary to infection and/or
atelectasis.

EKG: sinus rhythm left atrial abnormality; first degree AV
delay; LVH; stable delayed RWP; stable TWI in V5; new ST
depression in V5-V6

TTE 2025-01-06:
Conclusions
The left atrial volume index is severely increased. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 8 mmHg mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the distal septum, anterior wall, lateral wall and apex
(distal anterior wall nearly akinetic but not thinned). The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45 % visually, 49%
by biplane). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated Tricuspid annular
plane systolic excursion is normal (1.9 cm; nl>1.6cm) consistent
with normal right ventricular systolic function. There is
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with mild regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD in the mid-dstail LAD territory.
Mildly dilated, hypertrophied right ventricle with normal
systolic function. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.

CXR AP 2025-01-06:
IMPRESSION:
Parenchymal opacities in both lower lobes have improved. This
most likely represents resolving pneumonia. Pulmonary edema has
also improved. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No
pneumothorax is seen.

RLE LENIS:
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower
extremity veins.

===============
Mr. Anderson is a 1979 w/ ESRD Hypertension DM & HTN on HD,
HFrEF (previously HFpEF), T2DM, & pulmonary HTN, initially
presenting from OSH w/ dyspnea & HTN, found to have pulmonary
edema, CAP, & influenza, transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital MICU for BiPAP and
quickly transitioned to room air, then transferred to the
medical floor for further stabilization.

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED:
========================
# Acute HFrEF (previously HFpEF):
# Pulmonary edema:
Dyspnea on presentation w/ pulmonary edema on CXR, elevated
BNP,crackles, edema & elevated JVP all supportive of acute heart
failure likely related to influenza and elevated blood
pressures, required BiPAP and nitroglycerin drip at Port Jessica
which was discontinued on arrival to MICU. On TTE found to have
LVEF 45% newly reduced from 55% in 2025-02-26 possibly ISO
influenza though echocardiogram showed hypokinesis in LV
mid-distal region concerning for underlying CAD. Troponin
elevated to 0.68 but ISO ESRD and flat CK-MB & an EKG without
ischemic changes this was thought to be STEMI demand. He was
admitted to MICU initially requiring BiPAP for one night and
then transitioned to NC and then room air. His symptoms improved
with fluid removal via HD and control of BP. He was initially
treated with torsemide 80mg daily & with clinical improvement
returned to his home diuretic dose of torsemide 60mg daily. On
discharge, he was oxygenating well on room air.

# Influenza B:
Influenza B positive at OSH. Treated with 5-day course of
oseltamavir.

# CAP:
Noted to have parenchymal opacities in both lower lobes on CXR.
He is s/p linezolid, azithromycin & piperacillin-tazobactam 2025-06-15,
transitioned to levofloxacin 2025-01-25 to complete a 5-day course.

# HTN:
Treated with nitroglycerin drip in Port Jessica, discontinued on
arrival to the MICU. He was ultimately transitioned to home
antihypertensives labetalol, amlodipine, and hydralazine without
any changes.

# ESRD related to DM & HTN on HD MWF:
Continued on HD on Mon/Wed/Fri HD schedule and home calcium acetate 1334 mg PO
TID.

# T2DM:
Continue homed glargine + SS.

# CAD:
Continued home ASA + statin.

# Chronic normocytic anemia:
Likely Complications of Surgery ESRD. Did not require transfusion.

# Chronic thrombocytopenia:
Previously evaluated by Hem-Onc who felt that this was mild case
of ITP. Platelet dropped on initial presentation to the Port Jessica
likely related to acute infection from influenza, uptrending on
discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
 Will complete levofloxacin 500mg Q48H 2025-01-10 for 5-day
course.
 LVEF 45% newly reduced from 55% in 2025-02-26 w/ echocardiogram
showing hypokinesis in LV mid-distal region concerning for
underlying CAD w/ troponin elevated to 0.68 (ISO ESRD and flat
CK-MB & an EKG without ischemic changes this was thought to be
STEMI demand). Should have repeat TTE in 1 month to re-evaluate,
consider outpatient stress. Outpatient PCP & Cardiologist
notified of these results prior to discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr Anderson,

It was a pleasure to care for you at the Apollo Medical Center
Pulmonology Unit.

Why did you come to the hospital?
- You felt short of breath and had low oxygen levels. You were
found to have the flu and pneumonia and high blood pressures.

What did you receive in the hospital?
- You had assistance with breathing with a breathing mask
temporarily and received medications to treat the flu and
antibiotics for pneumonia. You had to be monitored in the ICU
temporarily and received medications to treat very high blood
pressures and improved.

What should you do once you leave the hospital?
- It is very important you follow up with your primary care
doctor and cardiologist as you need more testing of your heart.
You also need to continue taking medicines for the flu and
antibiotics for pneumonia as instructed.
- Please take the last dose of your antibiotics tomorrow.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your Pulmonology Unit Care Team

History of Present Illness:
Mr Jasmin Bishop is an 2020 year old man with a history of severe aortic
stenosis, hypertension, postate cancer s/p XRT, diverticulosis,
hypothyroidism presenting with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
inability to tolerate food or fluids.

He states that 2 weeks ago, he developed decreased appetite
without any other symptoms. Several days later he developed
initially mild watery diarrhea (several episodes per day).
Starting one week ago, his diarrhea worsened in terms of
frequency and amount - was having multiple episodes (1â2/day) of
voluminous watery diarrhea per day. He also at this time
developed nausea, abdominal cramping, and vomiting (several
episodes per day). He has been using adult diapers since he
often wakes up with incontinent stool at night. Unable to eat or
drink anything for multiple days, since any intake will result
in hours of near constant diarrhea.

He originally was seen at Orthopedic Surgery Department 3 days PTA with N/V/D and loss
of appetite and was given PO Zofran. Thought was norovirus at
the time. He was referred in to Toronto General Hospital ED from Orthopedic Surgery Department
after presenting with ongoing symptoms to a follow-up
appointment on 2025-02-08 with worsening sx. He had inability to
adequate hydrate (drinking water cause diarrhea), feeling
constant chills. Neither of his roommates are sick. Reported 5
pound weight loss over the course of the week.
No recent travel or new sexual encounters.

ROS is positive for occasional lightheadedness with standing.
Denies fevers, sweats, blood or mucus in stools, dysuria,
hematuria, chest pain, dyspnea, lower extremity edema,
orthopnea, palpitations. No recent consumption of unpasteurized
foods, raw/undercooked meat/fish; no visits to daycare, schools,
nursing homes. No recent cruise or camping/hiking.

hypertension, postate cancer s/p XRT, diverticulosis,
hypothyroidism presenting with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
inability to tolerate food or fluids.

#Acute diarrhea: Patient presented with ongoing voluminous
watery diarrhea. Highest on the differential was viral
gastroenteritis, given his lack of bloody stools, normal white
count, lack of fevers or belly pain. He had studies suggestive
of an osmotic diarrhea, and given his bouts of recurrent chronic
diarrhea, may warrant more of a workup in the patient setting.
He had negative stool studies. He was treated with IVF PRN and
with Zofran for nausea.

# Chest pain: On hospital day 1 patient had an episode of chest
pain that was dull, left-sided radiating to the shoulder, and
lasted for several hours. Trops were negative. EKG did not show
acute changes. He may have become symptomatic from his known
severe AS; patient has refused further w/u for a TAVR in the past and continues to do so during this admission.

# Severe aortic stenosis: continued on home medications
including lisinopril, metoprolol and amlodipine. Our team was
not able to confirm that he was truly taking lisinopril at home
since the last time he had filled it at his regular pharmacy was 2025-04-24.

2025-04-20: Pt presented w/ Cr 1.5, previous baseline 1.1, like
pre-renal in the setting of dehydration associated with voluminous diarrhea.
This improved with fluids.

# Hypovolemic hyponatremia: Na initially 132 most likely from
decreased volume status associated with diarrhea. This remained stable
during his stay and Na on discharge was 133.

***Transitional issues***:
- would benefit from HIV testing in the outpatient setting,
since if he is immunocompromised this changes the differential
for his diarrhea.
- patient reports familiarity with lisinopril but is unsure if
he is taking it; because his blood pressure was systolic 100's
on day of discharge, this medication was discontinued. He should
confirm whether he is taking this medication or not at his next
PCP 2025-08-06.
- found to have subclinical hypothyroidism; this could be a
result of his acute illness but TSH should be followed up in 26
months.
- patient has had recurrent episodes of chronic diarrhea that
appear to self-resolve. His stool studies here showed evidence
of osmotic diarrhea, and hydrogen breath test may be considered
as an outpatient to eval for SIBO or carbohydrate malabsorption.

- patient has hiatal hernia and reports intermittent episodes of
regurgitation. Although no known episodes of aspiration may
benefit from a speech/swallow test in the outpatient setting.
- code status: DNR/DNI

IMAGING
=========================
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound 2025-02-07: 1. Extensive deep
venous thrombosis involving the left lower extremity veins
from the common femoral through the calf veins.
2. Deep venous thrombosis involving the right calf veins.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: Renee Mendoza h/o HTN, HLD, DMII, recent right frontal IPH who
presents with acute bilateral DVTs. Due to his recent
intracranial hemorrhage, anticoagulation was contraindicated in
this patient. An IVC filter was placed, and he was discharged
back to rehab.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# Bilateral DVTs: Patient presented with left lower extremity
swelling, and found on ultrasound to have acute bilateral DVTs.
No symptoms or vital sign instability suggestive of pulmonary
emboli. In setting of recent ICH, systemic anticoagulation is
contraindicated. IVC filter placement was performed on 2025-07-23.
Procedure was tolerated well and uncomplicated. He will be
scheduled for outpatient followup with Bring detailed family history records for further genetic assessment..

# Right frontal IPH: S/p recent hospitalization, patient with
improving L-sided weakness. Follow up is scheduled with Dr.
Kelly White on 2025-03-24.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HTN: Goal SBP < 150 given bleed. Well controlled this
admission on home meds. Continued amlodipine, carvedilol,
lisinopril
# Glaucoma: continued latanoprost.
# IDDM: Continued insulin sliding scale.
# h/o seizure, ICH: Continued keppra 500mg bid.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- IVC filter placed 2025-07-23 (left iliac vein access), needs to be
followed up with Tricia Nichols - they will reach out to patient in 29
weeks. This was confirmed on day of discharge with the Pathology team.
- Patient will follow up with Dr. Kelly White his IPH on 2025-03-24
- Please encourage ambulation and consider compression stockings
- Patient will need to establish care with a PCP (does not have
one). However, going to rehab facility so did not set this up
for him.
- Consider Hematology/Oncology appointment for work up of
bilateral DVTs (although likely from sedentary lifestyle in
setting of recent illness).
- Patient had been scheduled for a 6 week follow up brain MRI,
however was admitted during this time. Patient will need a
follow up MRI rescheduled within one-two weeks (to follow up on
intracranial bleed). Had a non-contrast MRI in-house but will
likely need to be repeated with contrast if desired by
outpatient neurosurgeon.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Lee,

You were admitted to Manipal Hospitals because you had a blood clot in your
legs, also called a deep venous thrombosis. Because you had a
recent bleed in your brain, we did not put you on blood
thinners.

We placed an IVC filter in you. This is a device that will
prevent the blood clot in your legs from moving to your lungs.
However, you will continue to have clots in your legs and may
experience some leg swelling.

Please continue to work with the staff at your rehab and follow
up with Dr. Kelly White as below.

- Your Max Super Speciality Hospital care team

Followup Instructions:
Follow post-surgical pain management plan and taper medications slowly."

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Carpenter is an 1993 with PMH breast and ovarian cancer s/p
mastectomy and hysterectomy who presents as a transfer from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital for shortness of breath and Madisonfort edema. She was found to
have new-onset Afib with RVR and severe MR with possible
disrupted valve c/f endocarditis and was transferred to Columbia Asia Hospital
for further evaluation by Thomas Washington for valve replacement vs.
medical management.

Patient initially presented to St. Georgeâs University Hospital on 2025-03-08 and stated that
she had been having shortness of breath for several weeks,
worsening over the past few days. At the same time, she also
started to notice lower extremity edema. Patient states that SOB
worse with exertion and has been limiting her recent mobility.
No orthopnea or PND. She also notes that she has had
intermittent ""gas pain"" in her midsternum region and epigastric
regions. No pattern to this discomfort, not necessarily with
exertion. Self-resolves. She denies nausea, diaphoresis, arm
pain or jaw pain.

Found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR treated with
diltazem and severe MR with evidence of valvular disruption, and
mod/severe TR and therefore Cardiac Surgery was consulted and
surgery was recommended.

Conclusions
The left atrial volume index is severely increased. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild to
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. An eccentric,
posteriorly
directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid valve
prolapse is present. Moderate to severe 3+ reflex tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.

Chest Xray:
2025-04-01 CXR from 2025-04-01:
IMPRESSION: Improved CHF. Small pleural effusions.

2025-03-13 CTPA from 2025-03-13:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate right greater than left pleural effusions.
3. Moderate cardiomegaly and mild edema.
4. Bibasilar atelectasis with area of consolidation in the right
lower lobe which could represent superimposed infection.
.
TEE Intra-op
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal for the
patient's body size. There is mild to moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (estimated LVEF = 40-45%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis.Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened with
myxomatous degeneration. There is severe anterior leaflet mitral
valve prolapse involving the A2 and A3 scallops. There is P3
leaflet prolapse. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There are at least two regurgitant jets- the largest jet is
eccentric and posteriorly-directed, located between A3-P3. The
smaller jet is between A1-A2/P1-P2. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened with myxomatous changes and leaflet
prolapse. There is annular dilation. Moderate Mild tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.

POST-BYPASS:

The patient is initially in an atrially-paced rhythm and later
in sinus rhythm, and receiving norepinephrine, epinephrine, and
vasopressin infusions.

1. Left ventricular function is moderately depressed (estimated
LV EF 35-40% on inotropic/vasoactive support). There is
paradoxical septal motion.
2. Right ventricular function is severely depressed after
initial separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Over time, there
is slight improvement Dysfunction is moderate completion of the
case.
3. The mitral valve is status post repair and annuloplasty
ring. There is trivial residual regurgitation. There is a peak
gradient of 7 mmHg and a mean gradient of 2 mmHg at a cardiac
output of 3L/min.
4. The tricuspid valve is status post repair and annuloplasty
ring. There is trivial residual regurgitation. Peak gradient
across the valve is 3 mmHg, mean gradient is 1 mmHg.
5. There is small residual left atrial appendage (extending
approximately 1.4 cm beyond the neck of the appendage).
6. The pericardial effusion is no longer present.
7. The thoracic aorta is intact following decannulation.

Pt was admitted 2025-01-10 and was taken to the operating room on
2025-04-03 and underwent MV repair and TV repair and Full left
and right-sided maze procedure with left atrial appendage
ligation. Please see operative note for full details. Pt
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in
stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.

Pt was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and
was extubated on POD 1. Pt was weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and pt was
diuresed toward her preoperative weight. Amio initiated for
AFib. Heart rate subsequently dropped to the 100 bpm (upper normal limit) and she
required pacing. Amio and Lopressor discontinued.
Anti-coagulation initiated w Coumadin. Heart rate recovered and
Lopressor was resumed. INR rose quickly and Coumadin was held
several days to allow for removal of epicardial pacing wires.
Pt remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing
wires discontinued. Coumadin resumed at low dose. Pt was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
their strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 6
pt was ambulating with assistance, all wounds were healing, and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics. Pt was discharged to the
Richard Davis in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Williams is an 1983 year-old woman with history of myocardial
infarction and PCI in 2011, HTN and HL who presented with
chest/neck pain and found to have new onset atrial fibrillation.

.
#. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has no known history of afib
prior to this admission. On presentation to the ED here, the
patient was in afib with HR of 110-120 and an ECG showing ST
depressions in V4-V6, I, aVL, 1 mm deeper from prior. She was
otherwise hemodynamically stable. The patient was given
intra-venous lopressor with good response and started on oral
metoprolol. The patient remained in atrial-fibrillation for
approximately 24 hours before spontaneously converting back to
sinus on hospital day #1. She was continued on oral metoprolol
and was started on dabigatran for anti-coagulation given CHADs
of 2. The patient had 2 additional episodes of likely afib on
telemetry although was asymptomatic during those episodes. A
TTE was done showing an enlarged left atria but no valvular
abnormality. She will be discharged on dabigatran and
metoprolol with plans to follow-up with a cardiologist.
.
#. Rule-out ACS: The patient presented with chest pressure and
shortness of breath. Her troponins were negative in the ED here
although she did have increased ST-depressions on ECG as
described above. She underwent exercise and nuclear stress
testing which were largely unremarkable. Believe that ischemic
type pain may be due to increased demand in the setting of rapid
afib. Chest pain resolved with rate control.
.
# Urinary Tract Infection: The patient complained of
foul-smelling urine on review of systems. Urinalysis performed
that was c/w UTI. This may be the inciting factor in the
patient's new afib. Patient has a history of frequent UTIs and
reports having had bad reations in the past to bactrim and
macrobid. Started on ciprofloxacin and will complete a 10-day
course. Will follow-up with her urologist and PCP about the
possibility of UTI prophylaxis.
.
#. Hypertension: Continued enalapril/amlodipine.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvatstain.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Charles Vargas is an 2019 M with history of Type B thoracic aortic
dissection s/p endovascular stent graft placement (combined
cardiac
and vascular procedure with Dr. Yolanda Brown Dr. Connie Bryant.
He returned with a Type A dissection and underwent resection of
ascending aortic aneurysm and dissection and ascending aortic
replacement on 2025-04-06.
He was discharged to rehab on 2025-02-01 and returned on 2025-06-03 to
ED with hypoxia and DOE despite being sent to rehab on 80mg
Lasix bid.

Chest xray revealed bilateral pleural effusions. IV Lasix was
attempted for diuresis without effect on effusions.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and he underwent
bilateral thoracenteses with improvement in his symptoms. The
fluid was sent for culture and it grew MSSA. ID was consulted
and recommended a two week course of Kefzol.

He remains on coumadin for Afib, his PEs and on last admission
was found to have an acute-appearing, near occlusive thrombus in
the left internal jugular and subclavian veins.

He is discharged to New Sarahberg with follow-up
instructions.

Chief Complaint:
inability to ambulate

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
2019 yo F with reported PMHx
significant for lyme disease and depression, who presents with
inability to ambulate and concern for muteness.

History obtained from the husband who was at the bedside, at the
request of the patient. Patient is able to comprehend and
comment
on aspects of the discussion but whispers throughout the
conversation and is oftentimes difficult to understand.

Patient was in her usual state of health up until 2025-07-18:
- 2025-07-15: Patient lost her ability to speak entirely. She was
very confused, lost taste sensation and ability to feel warmth,
with periods of 'memory fog' and jumbling of words (e.g lottery
ticket -> 'pottery licket'). She was brought to the ED in Branchbury
where she lived at the time and was admitted to a psychiatric
unit. Tests were done but ultimately no formal diagnosis was
determined for her constellation of symptoms and patient was
started on Fluoxetine for Depression
- 2025-04-03, patient had regained her ability to speak but
people they knew mentioned that many of her symptoms could be
seen with Lyme disease (headaches, body pain). Evaluated in
Branchbury and blood tests were positive for Lyme disease. Treated
with Doxycline, infusions, tinctures
- Through 01:37 PM - 05:01 PM, periods of inability to speak would
happen intermittently, usually upon awakening in the morning,
with recovery later on in the day
- During these episodes of muteness, patient is able to
comprehend speech without issue but is unable to vocalize aside
from 'occasional gibberish'. Even when asked to write her
thoughts, they come out as 'gibberish'
- Throughout 2021, episodes of muteness become more frequent
- 2025-04-19 to present: Episodes of muteness last longer, up to
days at a time. She feels constantly lightheaded (denies
sensation of room spinning) with daily headaches. Occasionally
with 30 second episodes of tremors involving various body parts
(leg vs arm) that resolve on its own (no generalized
seizure-like
activity)
- over past 5 days, nausea is a daily occurrence (no vomiting).
Also endorses chills and inability to walk. She is unsteady and
shaky on her feet. Husband describes it as a 'mental disconnect""
with an inability to move her legs reflexively. She must now
consciously decide to move her legs and is unable to do so at
times. She denies any recent psychosocial stressors.
Furthermore,
patient denies any fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath,
cough, abdominal pain, dysuria/hematuria or diarrhea.

Of note, she follows with ND Katherine Hunter, naturopathic
doctor,
for most of her care and last saw Katherine Hunter earlier this month
where she was told that her 'Lyme counts are low.' Patient was
prescribed Prednisone to be taken for one month (she is now on
week 3) for 'brain inflammation' diagnosed based off of her
reported symptoms. Given her overall lack of improvement and the
impact it was having on her life, Katherine Hunter recommended that the
patient see an ID specialist. Due to her worsening symptoms over
the past five days, patient and her husband presented to Stanford Health Care
ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: 36.5Â°C 96 129/76 16 98%RA
Labs showed: WBC 12.6, otherwise normal CBC/BMP/LFTs, negative
serum/urine tox.

Brief Hospital Course:
====================
PATIENT SUMMARY:
====================
2019 yo F with reported PMHx significant for lyme disease and
depression, who presents with muteness and five days of nausea,
lightheadedness, and inability to ambulate. No clear underlying
infectious, autoimmune or inflammatory cause identified, most
likely secondary to conversion disorder vs. somatization.

====================
ACUTE ISSUES:
====================
#Muteness
#Inability to ambulate.
Patient presents with muteness and a constellation of other
neurological symptoms that began in 2025-02-19 and have become more
persistent since 2025-02-19. Given the patient's combination of
neurological symptoms that do not correspond to a neurological
disease and the fact that initial and current symptoms began in
the setting of life stresses/changes, conversion disorder is
most likely. Many of the patient's symptoms (jarbled language,
whispered tone, lower extremity paralysis out of proportion to
her physical exam) are commonly seen in conversion disorder.
Psychiatry and neurology were consulted for work up of weakness
and mutism. Toxic/metabolic workup was negative with negative
serum/urine tox, reassuring electrolytes, CBC, and TFTs. Brain
MRI was unremarkable. RPR, HIV, B12, TSH, CRP were normal. EEG
for seizure activity was unremarkable. dsDNA, ANCA, ANA positive, ESR, SM antiboidy, paraneoplastic were pending at the time of discharge.
She will follow up with neurology as outpatient to discuss the
pending labs. She started working with physical therapy as
inpatient and should continue physical therapy when she leaves
the hospital. Recommended that she establish care with
psychiatry and psychology close to home.

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
N/A Continue to work with physical therapy
N/A Follow-up with neurology at St. Mary's Hospital
N/A Establish care with psychiatry close to home
N/A Stopped prednisone

- New Meds: none
- Stopped/Held Meds: prednisone
- Changed Meds: none
- Follow-up appointments: she will schedule neurology at St. Mary's Hospital

2009 Hispanic only F with HTN, glaucoma, arthritis
transferred from Mercy Health Hospital to NYU Langone Medical Center with chest pressure. 2
days prior to admission, pt developed multiple episodes of
precordial chest pressure that each lasted 46 minutes. Chest
pressure was non-radiating, not induced by exercise, not
relieved by rest or taking an extra anti-hypertensive med, nor
associated w/ SOB, nausea. Per pt, similar episodes had happened
in the past and pt was found to have an ""enlarged heart chamber""
by stress test and ""treated for heart problems"" in 2004. As
chest pressure recurred the following day (day prior to
admission), pt's daughter took her to Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore for
further evaluation. At Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore, patient received asa and
nitro and CP resolved. Troponin was negative. Once patient was
stabilized, she was transferred from Columbia Asia Hospital Boston, MA to NYU Langone Medical Center
for further eval/mgmt.

PAIN, EVAL FOR REVERSIBLE ISCHEMIA
IMPRESSION:
1. Small size, mild severity, reversible perfusion defect in the
inferior

ventricular size and systolic function.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of 2025-02-08 11:12 03:36 PM
IMPRESSION: Right hilar prominence, recommend additional oblique
views to
better visualize the hilar structure. Discussed with Kevin Robbins QA

CHEST (BOTH OBLIQUES ONLY) Study Date of 2025-02-08 5:38 03:36 PM
The right hilum is grossly unremarkable on these views. No CHF,
focal
infiltrate, or effusion is identified. Again noted are the
calcifications
projecting over the right lung base, which are believed to lie
within the
right breast.
Cardiac Cath 2025-02-01:
1. Coronary arteries were free of angiographically-apparent
flow-limiting stenoses.
2. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
3. Severe systemic arterial hypertension.
4. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
## Chest pain: Pt with unclear CAD history presented with
atypical chest pain and she was ruled out for an MI with three
negative sets of CEs. She underwent PMIBI on 2025-05-30 which showed
small reversible perfusion defect in the inferior wall. Medical
regimen was increased with Imdur and pt continued to have chest
pain that would resolve with sublingual nitro. After discussion
General Medicine cardiology & interpreter, pt decided to undergo cardiac
cath which revealed no angiographically significant coronary
artery disease. Pt was discharged on the Armenia equivalent
medications for Aspirin, long acting nitrate and ace inhibitor.
She was started on Metoprolol 12.5mg twice daily and she was not
continued on a statin given that her lipid panel was at goal.
Pt was scheduled to follow with new PCP at Wallsmouth and with
cardiology in South Rachel.
.
## R hilum on initial CXR: Pt was incidentally noted to have
some calcifications on CXR over the right breast. Oblique views
showed calcifications projecting over the R lung base which were
believed to lie within the R breast. Pt reported having normal
mammograms in 2003 and was educated about the importance of
getting another mammogram to better evaluate this finding. Pt
also reported having undergone surgery on the R breast in the
past and felt that this finding may have been due to scar
tissue.
.
## HTN: BP was moderately well controlled in house. Pt wanted
to continue on home regimen Armenia medications given that she
did not have any insurance coverage for her medications. She
was discharged on an ACE inhibitor and long acting nitrate
Armenia meds). She was also started on Metoprolol 12.5mg BID
(limited betablockade due to sinus bradycardia to 150 bpm (severe tachycardia) seen when
sleeping) .
.
## Glaucoma: Pt was treated with dorzolamide 2% solution 1 drop
BID and timolol maleate 0.5% 1 drop bid while in house and was
encouraged to resume her glaucoma home regimen on discharge.

Chief Complaint:
""My PCP and therapist said I should go to the ED.""

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
1980 yom, primarily 2021 speaking, with history of obsessive
compulsive disorder, chronic headache, PTSD, anxiety/depression
self presented to the ED at the urge of his PCP due to
deterioration in ability to care for self over the past month
evidenced by his self-isolation, insomnia, and poor appetite w/
accompanying 12lbs unintentional weight loss over the past
month.

The patient has had numerous stressors over the past 3 months,
including very limited Self-pay with poor Children involved support
system, relationship stressors w/ wife and 2015 yo step-son, and
severe OCD traits interfering with daily function. He states
that roughly 3 months ago he was helping his wife with chores
when he developed a particularly painful headache and since then
he has not had the motivation to leave the house, staying mostly
in his room and watching TV.

He has a poor relationship with his 2015 step-son, who has
recently been diagnosed with severe ADHD. He fears his
step-son's behavioral issues, particularly afraid that the
step-son would harm his Kimberly Coleman son. The discord between the patient
and his step-son has lead to further relationship turmoil
between he and his wife, to the point where his wife restricts
the patient's interaction with his Kimberly Coleman son. He also fears his
step-son will become violent with him and his wife will
subsequently call the police, she has been shutting himself in
his room. He suspects his wife and his step-son are talking
badly about him behind his back. He does not leave the room even
to urinate, holding it for many hours and sometimes urinating in
a bottle. When asked if we could speak with his wife, he
declined, stating that he is afraid she will divorce him, he
will lose his visa and have to leave the country, and lose
custody over his son. He would like to divorce his wife now but
does not have the money to hire an attorney.

One week ago he lost a credit card while he was shopping, his
wife then restricted all his money, so he has to borrow money
from friends to pay for his PCP and counselor. He had a dream 3
days ago that someone had killed him and has not had appetite
since, eating only candy and tea. He states he cannot sleep at
home because his step-son recently threatened to kill him and
his wife threatened to hit him with a computer. He states he is
""mentally damaged"".

He denies thoughts of harming self, stating he needs to take
care of his son, denies thoughts of harming others, and denies
auditory or visual hallucinations. He endorses poor sleep,
fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss, and poor concentration. He
states his OCD is very severe and that he has numerous
compulsions throughout the day including washing his hands
repeatedly, refusing to use public toilet, public phone, door
knobs, etc. He perseverates on the lucky day of the month,
""engi"".

Brief Hospital Course:
1980 yo married male, Hispanic 2019, with history of OCD,
chronic headaches, anxiety/depression, sent to the ED by his PCP
for inability to care for self in the setting of numerous
familial/marital stressors over the past 3 months, resulting in
poor intake and 12 lb weight loss over 1 month. He describes
ongoing depressed mood for about 1.5:1 year, and while he states his
OCD symptoms have reduced over the past 4:1 years since he has
moved to the 25, he has found his symptoms have been
quite distressing for him recently. He experiences recurrent
persistent thoughts regarding contamination, which are
neutralized by such behaviors as washing his hands repeatedly,
and forcing his family to shower when returning home. His fear
of contamination had impaired his social and occupational
functioning to the degree that he left his former job as a Chartered accountant
Chartered accountant due to fear of entering other people's homes. His
presentation is most consistent with obsessive compulsive
disorder with poor insight. He also presents with numerous
symptoms of a major depressive episode, including decreased
appetite/weight loss, anhedonia, hypersomnia, fatigue and
depressed mood, which had impaired his functioning in that he
was unable to properly care for himself or his children, and
spent most of his day locked in his room. He appears to have
experienced depressive episodes similar to this in the past, and
his presentation is also consistent with major depressive
disorder, severe, recurrent.

1.Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted on a Voluntary, and
signed a CV Surgical. He was maintained on 15 minute checks
throughout his stay.

2.Medical:
Migraines: Patient was maintained on home medication of
topirimate 50mg 1:2 qhs, as well as PRN medications of
acetaminophen 650mg 1:2 and ibuprofen 600mg 1:2. He noted a great
decrease in the frequency and severity of his headaches
throughout his hospitalization.

Patientâs PCP Erik George was contacted at time of admission in
order to discuss circumstances of patientâs hospitalization and
to obtain relevant history. At time of discharge, ptâs PCP was
contacted again to provide discuss hospital course and discharge
disposition.

3.Psychiatric:
Extensive time was spent discussing the patientâs diagnosis and
psychopharmacology issues. Outpatient psychiatric medications
were continued at home doses including fluvoxamine 100mg 1:2 qhs.
As patient felt as though he did not tolerate higher doses of
this medication in the past, clomipramine 50mg 1:2 daily was
added to address both OCD and symptoms of depression, and was
eventually uptitrated to clomipramine 100mg 1:2 qhs. B/R/AE/SE
were discussed, and patient verbalized his understanding. This
medication was well-tolerated, with mild dry throat/mouth
occurring. To augment his antidepressant therapy, aripiprazole
5mg 1:2 daily was added, B/R/AE/SE were discussed, and patient
verbalized his understanding. Throughout his hospitalization, he
experienced difficulty sleeping. Lorazepam 1mg 1:2 qhs was
initially used, as well as hydroxyzine 50mg 1:2 qhs. Patient
continued with difficulty sleeping despite increases in these
dosages, and ultimately zolpidem 10mg 1:2 qhs was initiated.
Lorazepam 1mg 1:2 qhs was discontinued upon initiating zolpidem,
and was utilized on a BID PRN basis for anxiety with good
effect. B/R/AE/SE were discussed, and patient verbalized his
understanding. He experienced improvement in his mood, a
decrease in handwashing behaviors, appeared less perseverative
regarding contamination fears and experienced a reduction of
overall anxiety/worries. While there were increased OCD
behaviors such as hand-washing following/anticipating stressful
family meetings with his wife, these would resolve and did not
persist, and responded well to lorazepam 1mg PRN. Many of his
depressive symptoms appeared to improve as his sleep pattern
improved as well, and he was often visible attempting to
communicate Diagnosis peers, and was active in the milieu. He noted he
often spent much of the day sleeping at home prior to admission,
and he was able to establish an appropriate sleep-wake cycle
throughout his admission.

Patientâs outpatient therapist Donald Johnson (PT) was
contacted at time of admission in order to discuss circumstances
of patientâs hospitalization and to obtain relevant history. At
time of discharge, ptâs outpatient therapist was contacted again
to discuss hospital course and discharge disposition.

4.Substance Abuse:
Patient was counseled to stop smoking and abusing nicotine
products. He was maintained on nicoderm patches throughout his
stay.

5.Social/Milieu:
Pt was encouraged to participate in unitâs groups/milieu/therapy
opportunities. As the language barrier presented difficulty in
him being able to engage in group activities, he was allowed use
of his phone to help manage his anxiety/provide distraction, and
also to use as a communication device. Therapy addressed
family/social issues. Patient experienced significant social
stressors while hospitalized, including his wife placing a
restraining order on him and him being unable to return home/see
his children and ultimately deciding to return to Stricklandland, Bolivia.
Patient and wife were involved in several family meetings
focused on psychoeducation and discharge planning. As patient
was 1975 speaking, interpreter services and language line
services were utilized throughout the duration of his stay.

6.Risk Assessment:
Patient had initially denied SI/HI upon admission. While he
developed thoughts of not wanting to be alive after learning
about the restraining order and when he feared he would never
see his son again, these thoughts were fleeting, and never did
he develop a plan nor intent. These thoughts resolved by the
following day in both instances, and he consistently
demonstrated future and goal-oriented thinking, as evidenced by
his verbalizing his plans to return to Stricklandland, Bolivia, find employment,
and continue treatment, with the ultimate goal of being able to
share custody of his son. Returning to Stricklandland, Bolivia allows him to have
greater social support, as in the 25 he has been
isolated. He consistently cited his son as a reason to want to
be alive. Protective factors include having an established
relationship with the outpatient treater he is returning to in
Stricklandland, Bolivia, as well as returning to his family/support network, being
motivated for ongoing treatment, and demonstrating future and
goal-oriented thinking. His risk factors of experiencing an
acute mood episode as well as his obsessive-compulsive disorder
have been treated pharmacologically. He has been medication
adherent, and has shown great improvement in his symptoms. At
this point in time, he does not present an imminent risk of harm
to self/others, and outpatient care is the least restrictive
level of care at this time.

7.Disposition: Return to Stricklandland, Bolivia and resume treatment with Dr.
Andrew Reynolds, T: 81-96(384) 1011, F:
81-96(385) 2890.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Appendectomy biopsy from the left inferior pole renal cortex.

History of Present Illness:
Richard Benson is a 1974 yo F with h/o SLE who is admitted after
renal biopsy for evaluation for lupus nephritis. Ms. Benson
reports over the past 1.5:1 years, she has had particular new
onset flare in her SLE symptoms. She had been on CellCept and
Benlysta but her CellCept recently was discontinued and she was
switched to methotrexate given ongoing active disease. Prior to
her biopsy, per nephrology note, she was experiencing mild
albuminuria and had stable normal function. She was accepted to
Toronto General Hospital for observation after a left renal biopsy to evaluate for
lupus nephrits given that she has a high-risk for bleeding (she
previously developed a significant hematoma after an ovarian
cystectomy in 2013). Since the biopsy this morning, she reports
10/10 (worst imaginable pain) diffuse pain in left flank that increases 10/10 (worst imaginable pain) with
standing. She was told by her nephrologist that in the weeks
after biopsy, she is not to lift anything weighing more than 5
pounds. She reports 2 instances of UOP since surgery with urine
dark in color and no blood noted in the urine. She reports that
she feels as though she can feel an acute flare in her symptoms
with some sore throat and sensation of returning
lupine/butterfly rash.

Brief Hospital Course:
Richard Benson is a 1974 year old female with history of SLE,
Raynaud's, and scleritis who was admitted on 2025-01-04 s/p renal
biopsy, now discharged POD#1. The biopsy was performed with goal
of understanding whether patient had evidence of lupus nephritis
process. She was admitted for concern for high risk of
post-surgical bleeding given previous history of post-surgical
hematoma.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#s/p renal biopsy: Given the concern for bleeding after this
patient, she was monitored for symptoms of internal bleeding and
did not have any acute symptoms such as hypotension or
tachycardia. In addition, hgb and hct studies were performed and
were stable over the course of her stay.

# Oral Health: After the renal biopsy, Mrs. Benson reported a
sore throat. In addition, she noted that she could feel an oral
lesion similar to others she has had in the setting of SLE
flares on the posterior aspect of her palate. No other erythema
was noted on exam but there was a white exudate noted on her
tongue that was suggestive of Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident) (thrush). She was given
her home Nystatin Oral Suspension for thrush and started on
Chloraseptic Throat Spray as needed.

#Fluid status: Patient initially reported decreased UOP but no
anuria. She had 2 UOPs evening after biopsy, 2 more UOP
overnight. Endorsed mild dysuria with some pain in left flank on
urination. She was replenished with normal saline during her
stay and PO intake was encouraged.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#SLE: All of Mrs. Benson home medications were continued
during her stay. She reported that for the past 6 months, she
had been experiencing a worsening of her SLE symptoms.

#Pain management: Mrs. Benson endorsed 10/10 (worst imaginable pain) pain in the left
flank with increase to 2/10 (mild) with standing or exertion. She was
continued on her home tramadol while inpatient. In addition,
oxycodone 10 mg was added PRn for breakthrough pain.

#Hypertension: Patient has history of well controlled
hypertension on nifedipine and amlopdipine. Her home medication
nifedipine was held given her well controlled BP on home
amlodipine 5. She was monitored for for hypotension during her
stay given risk of bleed.

# Constipation: Patient reported constipation since the biopsy.
Her home docusate was continued during her stay.

IMAGING
CXR 2025-02-05
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Available for comparison is the
next preceding chest examination of 2025-02-19. The on
previous examination identified right-sided PICC line has been
removed. Appearance of chest is grossly unaltered with heart
size within normal limits and no acute pulmonary abnormalities.
Although the cardiac area is somewhat underpenetrated, one can
identify an NG tube in the upper portion of the esophagus and
reappearance just below the diaphragm indicating that the tube
has reached well into the stomach where it is curled up. This
includes also the side port. No other significant findings on
this single chest view examination.

CXR 2025-02-05
PORTABLE SHALLOW OBLIQUE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Right upper
extremity PICC
terminates in the mid to lower SVC. Again seen are bibasilar
atelectasis,
with mild worsening of the right basal atelectasis. The
cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with a mildly
tortuous thoracic aorta. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
seen.

IMPRESSION: Right PICC terminates in the mid to lower SVC

Brief Hospital Course:
2008 yo male with ulcerative colitis s/p ileoanal pouch and
diverting ileostomy in 1980, presents with GI bleed and
hypotension after ileostomy closure.On 2025-03-31, patient underwent
takedown of ileostomy and is admitted to FICU from the PACU with
GIB and hypotension.

The patient's ileostomy takedown procedure went well;refer to
operative note for further details of surgery. While in the
PACU though, pt had a BM with 100 cc of frank blood, then
subsequently had another BM with 300 cc of frank blood. The pt
became hypotensive to 60-70s, hr 72 bpm (normal) and felt dizzy and
nauseous. He was given 4L of fluid, given a 100mcg of
phenylephrine and his BP improved. A foley was placed in the
patients rectum, and irrigated with clot. The patient is
currently receiving 2 units pRBCs.

On arrival to the FICU, patient's vs. were BP 133/51 HR 89 RR 17
100% on RA. He reports feeling tired, with abdominal pain over
ostomy removal site that he states is more superficial than deep
and rates a 7/10 (severe) with improvement with pain medication. He
states mild lightheadedness that was worse in the afternoon, and
nausea upon receipt of pain medications. Denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, cough, constitutional symptoms, dysuria,
recent illness.

# GI Bleed: Occurred s/p ileostomy takedown and completion of
the anastomosis, this is likely bleeding from the staple line,
which is usually self limited. Patient's HCT was initially 31.9
this trending downward to a nadir of 22. A rectal tube was
placed and bleeding continued. The patient additional was noted
to have one episode of hematemesis. A NGT was placed and lavage
returned dark blood. Hematemesis was attributed to backflow from
his anastomotic site bleed. He was given transfusions with a
goal HCT of 28. He required transfusion of a total of 13 units
of PRBCs and 2 units of FFP. Bleeding subsided and pressures
stabilized and patient HCT remained stable.

-# Bradycardia: Patient was initially noted to have a HR into
72 bpm (normal) while hypotensive. Inappropriate response to blood
pressure. Most likely Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to vagal event from bleeding, rectal
tube, pain, and may be exacerbated by reflex bradycardia from
phenylephrine. HR subsequently stabilized.
# Pain control: Pain was controlled with a morphine PCA.
STABLE ISSUES
# Ulcerative colitis: S/p proctocolectomy. No evidence of PSC
clinically.
# Hypertension: The patient's home amlodipine was held in the
setting of GIB.
# Hypotension: Most likely Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to bleeding and vagal response
given HR, presence of tube in rectum, as well as pain which per
nurse, often correlates with descent in HR. He was given fluid
boluses with LR and transfused as above. He initially required
phenylephrine however he was quickly weaned from pressor
support. The patient was without signs or symptoms of
infection. Patient blood pressure stabilized.

POD 3,patient was transferred to the floor. Patient remained NPO
with intravenous fluids and NGT in place. Patient NGT output was
monitored closely and was having large bilious output. A PICC
line was placed for intravenous fluids. POD 4,patient continued
to be diuresed with acetazolamide. The foley catheter was
discontinued and patient voided without difficulty.

POD 5 the nasogastric tube was discontinued and the diet was
advanced from clears to regular which was tolerated well.
Patient was noted to have copious amounts of stool output
greater than 2 liters per day and was started on psyllium
wafers. Patient intake and output were monitored closely.

POD 6 patient continued to have high stool output and was
started on loperamide. However continued to report having
multiple explosive non bloody stool output. Patient's loperamide
and psyllium wafers were titrated up as needed. Patient was
started on a regular diet and encouraged to increase fiber
intake to bulk up the stool. POD 7 patient reported no
significant change in bowel frequency and urgency. In addition
to his current bowel regimen he was started on Librium.(Librax
upon discharge). Patient mobility was limited due to increase
frequency and urgency of bowel movements. Thus patient was
started on Heparin subcutaneously for DVT prophylaxis. Patient
was encouraged to ambulate several times a day. Patient
hematocrit was monitored closely and was stable.

By POD 8 patient had satisfactory stool output on current bowel
regimen and was deemed ready for discharge to home. Patient was
instructed to monitor his stool output closely and to titrate
his bowel regimen (Loperamide, psyllium wafers and Librax) as
instructed by Dr. Jessica Simpson. Patient was also instructed to
monitor for dehydration and to keep with oral fluids. Patient
PICC line was discontinued prior to discharge. He will have his
staples removed at his PCP Tanya Gonzalez. Patient was discharged home
in good condition and will follow-up with Dr. Jessica Simpson in
clinic in 29 months.

Chief Complaint:
Code stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 2025 year-old right-handed woman with a history of
HTN, HLD and DM who presents with acute onset of aphasia. The
patient speaks only 1973, so the history is obtained with the
help of her son and daughter-in-law. Reportedly the patient was
having dinner around 7pm, when she suddenly began speaking in
gibberish. The family felt as though she was still able to
understand what they said to her, but her responses did not make
sense, and were not real words. As examples, when asked her
name, she would answer correctly, but would add multiple
additional gibberish syllables on at the end of her name.
Because of these symptoms EMS was called. When they arrived and
were trying to get her onto the stretcher, they noticed that she
seemed to be falling to the right, and was slightly weaker on
her right side.

The patient's family report that she was seen by a Neurologist
earlier this year because of concerns for confusion. They
report that she seemed to be more forgetful than usual, and it
was also noted at some point that she had left eye ptosis. She
was seen by Neurology, at which time she underwent an MRI, which
showed no signs of acute infarct, but did show chronic
microvascular disease, and it was thought that her symptoms were
secondary to multi-infarct dementia, and she was started on an
aspirin.

Patient providing non-sensical answers to all questions, so
unable to answer ROS.

CT head on 2025-07-03: 12 by 18mm hemorrhage of the left thalamic
region, with surrounding edema and moderate mass effect on the
body of the left lateral ventricle. The most likely etiology of
the hemorrhage is due to hypertension, as opposed to an
underlying mass lesion or vascular malformation, for example.

Follow-up CT on 2025-05-01: Slight decrease in density but unchanged
size of the left thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 2025 year old RHW from Los Angeles, CA (mostly 1973
only) with DM, HTN and HLD who lives at home requiring
assistance with most ADL's including feeding. She was found to
be suddenly speaking gibberish and patient was brought to the
hospital for acute stroke per EMS. She was also noted to be
listing to the R per EMS. CT head showed L thalamic hemorrhage
most consistent with hypertensive hemorrhage and her admission
BP was 172/88.

Patient was admitted to the neurology service. She underwent
repeat head CT the next day which showed stable L thalamic
hemorrhage. Exam also remained stable with occasional clear
speech but followed by gibberish. She does follow simple
commands in 1973. She continued to have mild R facial droop
with R sided weakness including limping in gait although
ambulatory with assistance.

Although no formal diagnosis, patient appeared to have cognitive
decline and required assistance with most ADL's including being
reminded to eat. Patient was initially confused upon admission,
likely delirium/""sundowning."" She was started on Seroquel 50mg
at evening - this can be titrated as needed.

Given the new weakness and speech trouble since the L thalamic
hemorrhage most likely due to hypertension, patient is
discharged to acute rehab for inpatient physical, occupational
and speech therapy.

Patient is to restart ASA 81 give days after discharge. She has
follow-up appt with Dr. Ariel Martinez, neurologist who oversaw her
care during this admission.

was on the left side. Your symptoms are due to this bleed. The
bleed was likely due to elevated blood pressures. Your blood
pressures have remained under good control in the hospital and
your blood pressure medications were not adjusted, aside from
the Amlodipine, which was increased to 5 mg daily. Your Aspirin
has also been held to prevent further bleeding and should be
restarted on 2025-05-31.
You were agitated initially during hospitalization and was
started on a medication called Seroquel to help with this. You
have been much calmer since starting this medication.

2019 y/o F with history of Alzheimer's disease presents s/p MVC
with parafalcine SDH and traumatic SAH. She was transferred to
Green Valley Hospital for further neurosurgical management. She was confused at
baseline and moving all extremities. She was admitted to
neurosurgery for monitoring overnight. She was placed on keppra
500mg BID. The family requested longterm placement so Neurology and OT
was consulted and Case Management was made aware. Speech and
swallow was also consulted. Her foley was discontinued and she
was started on Bactrim for a positive UA.

Early 2025-03-03 she was unable to void and a foley was replaced. Kevin Porter
RN did not feel the patient could safely take her PO antibiotic
so it was changed to IV ceftraxione in the meantime. Speech and
Swallow cleared the patient for grounds, thin liquids, and
crushed meds.

On 2025-05-07 she remained stable on the floor while awaiting rehab
screening.

On 2025-08-15, The patient had low urine output and was given Lasix.
The serum potassium was low and was repleated.

On 2025-01-22, The patient was not eating or drinking and had low
urine out put. This was discussed with the family and decision
was made to have a feeding tube placed for proper nutrition.
General surgery was called and a plan was made for the patient
to have a feeding tube placed in the operating room the
following day. The patients serum potassium, magnesium,
calcium were low and were repleated. A nutrition consult and
calorie count were ordred. A protable chest xray was performed
which was consistent with atelectesis vs pnemonia. A AP/LAT
chest xray was performed which was consistent with rapidly
improving bibasilar opacities favor either aspiration or
atelectasis.

On 2025-06-05, The Ceftriaxone course of antibiotic for a klebsiella
UTI was completed. Gtube placed by general suregry.

None


History of Present Illness:
This 2003 year-old right-handed woman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on warfarin in the setting of myocardial
infarction in 2017, also on ASA and Plaxix, with
hypertension, and breast cancer was transferred from Endocrinology Clinic for an atraumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
left parietal region, after ~48 hours of worsening language
difficulties noted by friends and family.

Her son, who is bedside, notes that she has had some difficulty
with naming (particularly proper names of Lindsey Wilson since 2025-04-03. However, on visiting his mother two days ago, he noted
that she was having troble naming common things like ""car."" Her
speech was not slurred. Yesterday, she was noted to have some
difficulty with memory according to another family member.
Later
in the day, her son noted that she signed a check without her
last name, then wrote a message in a card that made ""no sense.""
She made dinner for her family last evening, but her son became
increasingly concerned and brought her to Mercy Health Hospital this
morning at 6 am.

St. Georgeâs University Hospital ER staff records additionally indicate that
there was some concern about ""slurred speech"" and ""agnosia.""
Her
blood pressure on arrival there was noted at 128/80. She
received a CT scan of the head that revealed a 2.7 x 3.7 cm left
parietal hemorrhage with some mild surrounding edema.
Her INR was 3.5. She received Vitamin K, Warfarin and 10
units IV. She received FFP x 2 and Zofran. Sodium was 133 and
creatinine 1.2; EKG revealed atrial fibrillation. She was
medflighted to Mercy Health Hospital for for further evaluation.

CT CNS: 2025-04-23: Left parietotemporal parenchymal hemorrhage
is unchanged since 4 hours prior (at 02:29 PM).

MRI w/o contrast: 2025-04-29: While degraded by patient motion,
the FLAIR images are of sufficient quality to re-demonstrate
the large hemorrhage within the left posterior temporal lobe,
with extensive surrounding edema. There is associated
effacement of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle.
There is extensive high T2 signal within the periventricular
white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, which presumably
represents chronic small vessel infarction, given the patient's
very advanced age. There is at least one probable chronic
lacunar infarct within the inferolateral aspect of the right
cerebellar hemisphere. There is no shift of normally midline
structures.
Given patient age, there are the expected diffuse involutional
changes of the brain parenchyma.

MRA: 2025-02-02: Redemonstration of left temporal lobe
hemorrhage, without
definite signs of underlying pathological enhancement or
abnormal vascularity.

Ct scan: 2025-03-11: Multifocal pneumonia within the dependent
portions of the lung involving the posterior right upper lobe
and lower lobes bilaterally is most suggestive of aspiration
induced pneumonia. No reactive effusions or pericardial
effusions.

2. No focal mass lesions. Moderate centrilobular emphysema with
some
peripheral interstitial thickening and peripheral
bronchiolectasis, which
could relate to an underlying interstitial lung disease, NSIP
distribution.

3. Large type 3 hiatal hernia with no CT findings to suggest
gastric
volvulus.

4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease within the coronary tree
and
intrathoracic aorta which contains regions of ulcerating plaque.
Questionable thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Can
correlate with echo.


ECHO: 2025-02-11 The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of
mild to moderate (Mild) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic function. Mild
to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
No large left atrial thrombus seen, but transthoracic
echocardiography is inadequate for exclusion Jugular venous pressure elevated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms Nunez has remained stable during her hospitalization. Her
bleed does not seem to relate to a mass or AVM (MRI/ MRA
negative plus CT torso negative for tumor). She was on ASA plus
plavix and coumadin (INR was 3.5 at Pulmonology Clinic prior to
transfer). Her bleed may have occurred because her INR was
supertherapeutic. There was no previous history of trauma. The
location of the bleed argued against a HTN etiology. She may
have amyloid angiopathy (though there is no lobar distribution
in her bleed).
Her deficits were Wernicke's aphasia and pseudobulbar symptoms.

In addition, though she remained asymptomatic and afebrile with
normal WBC and Na levels, a PNA was reported in the CT study.
She was started on a cephalosporin plus clindamicin. She needs
to complete a total of 10 days of therapy (day 3 currently).
The risks and benefits of restarting coumadin after a period of
two weeks to protect her against ischemic stroke was discussed
with her son William Ferguson (who is her health care proxy). The risk of
coumadin causing a recurrent intracranial hemorrhage was
discussed. William Ferguson said that he did not want his mother restarted on
Coumadin held. She was
restarted on aspirin 81mg daily instead for secondary stroke
prevention. The plavix was not restarted (Her PMD Dr. Sara Dixon reported that prior to this hospitalization she had asked that the
Plavix be stopped).

CT HEAD
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or vascular territory infarction. Ventricles and sulci
are prominent in size bilaterally consistent with global
parenchymal volume loss. Note is made of old lacunar infarct at
the right basal ganglia. Extracranial soft tissue structures are
unremarkable. Note is made of a mucus retention cyst at the
right maxillary sinus as well as scattered opacities in the
ethmoid air cells bilaterally. The remainder of the paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. There is no fracture.
Note is made of cerumen impaction at the ears, which should be
clinically correlated.
.
2025-06-09 CXR
CONCLUSION:
1. Cardiomegaly with minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.
No focal
pulmonary consolidation.
2. Apparent inferior subluxation of the right humeral head,
unchanged since the radiograph of 2025-05-02 be projectional.
The possibility of
anteroinferior dislocation of the humeral head is not excluded
on the current radiograph and clinical and/or radiological
correlation is recommended.
.
2025-06-14 CTA Head
IMPRESSION:
1. Suggestion of an area of ischemia in the left
parieto-occipital lobe on
perfusion maps. MRI is more sensitive in evaluating for acute
ischemia and
would be beneficial in this case, if clinically indicated.
2. Significant luminal narrowing at the bifurcation of the left
carotid
artery, with combination of the soft and calcified plaque.
3. Less than 50% stenosis above the bifurcation of the right
carotid artery.
4. Vascular calcification are seen bilaterally.
5. Emphysema in the imaged upper portion of the lungs, and
atheromatous
changes in the aorta.
.
2025-06-26 Carotid Ultrasound
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild calcified plaque in the right internal carotid artery
with less than 40% stenosis.
2. Moderate calcified plaque in the left internal carotid artery
with 60-69% stenosis. This is a baseline examination at the
2025-05-24.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1997 y/o F with hx of recent NSTEMI s/p cath with RCA stent and hx
of afib with RVR presents after mechanical fall at home with
UTI, dehydration and afib with RVR. Rate responsive to
diltiazem. Blood pressures stable throughout. Now stable in rate
controlled afib on metoprolol and diltiazem.
.
# Rhythm: patient was asymptomatic in aflutter or afib with RVR
in the ED. Lopressor did not work and BP dropped to 100s from
120s. Upon arrival to the floor was given 15 mg IV dilt and
slowed from rates in 140s to 48 bpm (bradycardia).  IV dilt gtt was stopped
and she was transitioned to digoxin and PO verapamil.  On this
regimen she kept alternating between aflutter with rates in the
130s, afib with rates in the 90â100 bpm (normal sinus rhythm) and NSR with rates in the
48 bpm (bradycardia).  Eventually she was mostly in NSR and afib and not in
her fast rate aflutter.  We transitioned her from dig and
verapamil because we suspect that she may have periods of time
with dehydration and ARF in the future and has the potential to
have bad effects from dig toxicity.  We added metoprolol for the
cardiovascular protective effects with her low EF.  And we added
diltiazem for better rate control.  In all, she is on metoprolol
50 mg bid and diltizem 30 mg qid.  She did have HRs in the 72 bpm (normal)
the day of discharge, which is ok with this regimen.  Throughout
all this, she never had palpitations of symptoms.
.
# NSVT - one episode day 2 of admission, no more episodes
.
# Coronaries: has known 3 vessel CAD with recent stent to RCA in
2025-03-29, no signs of ischemia on EKG. Ruled out for MI with
enzymes.  At one point, she had about 5 minutes of jaw pain (her
anginal equivalent), when her rates were in the 140s.  When her
rates decreased the pain went away.  We are continuing her
medical management with aspirin 81 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily,
metorpolol as above and lipitor 80 mg daily.  She does not want
any more procedures, so will continue medical management.  Has
room for adding a long acting nitrate if symptomatic.
.
# Pump: has mildly depressed EF on echo in 2025-04-05. Is fluid up on
exam and held diuretics in the setting of dehydration and
prerenal ARF upon presentation.  Her oxygen requirement
increased the first few days.  Restarted her home chlorothiazide
and gave her two days of extra lasix and now she is satting well
on 2L NC.  Her pedal edema is much improved and we expect her to
be on room air in a few days.  Would continue her chlorothiazide
for now.  No lasix unless needed PRN.  Kidney funciton has
remained stable after first two days of admission.
.
# TIA - on night of 2025-01-29 into morning of 2025-04-06, patient had an
episode of aphasia and confusion without other deficits which
was deemed to be a TIA.  On CTA and perfusion study, she had an
area of ischemia in her L parietal-occipital region.  Her
symptoms resolved.  Neuro followed along and recommended
anticoagulation.  We had been avoiding anticoagulation in the
setting of afib per the patient's request, hx of remote GI bleed
and hx of falls in the fast few weeks.  After her TIA, we
readdressed the anticoagulation issue with the patient and more
strongly recommended coumadin and she was open to the
suggestion.  We started coumadin with a lovenox bridge.  She
will continue her bridge at rehab and have her coumadin titrated
to a goal fo 2.0 to 3.0.
.
# Hypoxia: baseline good sats on room air, required O2 while
here, likely from fluid overload as mentioned above.  No cough
or signs of PNA.
.
# Mechanical Fall: no signs of LOC or seizure like activity, no
symptoms of chest pain or palpitations. Likely was from a
combination of factors like deconditioning, UTI, afib, residual
stroke deficit on L side. No pain now, head CT negative, pelvis
stable on exam.  Pulmonology evaluated the patient and she did very
poorly.  Recommended rehab for patient but initially refused.
After having a few discussions, she was ammenable to
rehabilitation and sees how she is no longer independent like
she used to be.
.
# UTI: asymptomatic but probably contributed to fall.  She was
treated with 7 day course of bactrim.  Cultures showed alpha
strep colonies, no sensitivies were taken.  She initially had a
foley placed, but then removed the second day of admission.
.
# ARF: has Cr from 1.5 up from a baseline of 0.9, likely
prerenal based on fluid status. Normalized with gentle IVFs.
Discharge creatinine 0.8.
.
# DM: held home meds, ISS for now.
.
# HTN: mildly hypo to normotensive while titrating up digoxin
and verapamil.  Then was normotensive to hypertensive with SBPs
in 130s to 150s.  See rate control for the meds.  They should be
enough for good blood pressure control.
.
# FEN: general cardiac diabetic diet
.
# ACCESS: PIV's
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI - confirmed with patient this admission
.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
Gastroenterology Division

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
1. Atrial Flutter
2. Atrial Fibrillation
3. Coronary Artery Disease
4. Urinary Tract Infection
5. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure
6. Transient Ischemic Attack


Discharge Condition:
stable, afib rates up to 110s, normal sinus rates in 48 bpm (bradycardia)
mostly in NSR, afebrile, requiring nasal cannula O2 2L, not
ambulating on her own due to deconditioning


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after falling.  You were found
to have a urinary tract infection and have an irregular heart
rate that was very fast.  We treated your urinary tract
infection with an antibiotic.  For your heart rate, we first
tried IV diltiazem and then switched you to digoxin and
verapamil for a short while.  Because you have underlying heart
failure, we thought the best medicines would actually be
metoprolol and diltiazem, so you will be going home on these two
medicines.  You likely will continue to sometimes have fast
heart rates at times, but hopefully these medicines will prevent
it from being too fast.
.
You also had a small, reversible ""stroke"" called a TIA.  You are
back to your baseline.  It was probably from either a small clot
in your heart or a small clot from you neck artery (the
carotid).  We started blood thinners for you to prevent this
from happening again.
.
In terms of your other medicines, you should continue them as
you had been taking them previous to being admitted.
.
You also lost a lot of strength with the infection and the prior
heart attack.  You were not quite safe enough to go home by
yourself, so we recommend some time in rehabilitation.  You need
to work very hard with your physical therapists to improve your
strength.
.
Please return to your hospital if you have worsening chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomitting, falls, fevers, chills or any other concerns.
.
Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.

Followup Instructions:
Call the cardiologist immediately if chest pain or shortness of breath occurs."

HPI:
The pt is a 2005 year old woman with history of diabetes,
hypertension, left frontal meningioma s/p craniectomy for
resection 21 years ago, who presents with lethargy and mild
confusion after unwitnessed headstrike a few days ago.

The patient states that she was at home asleep on Tuesday night
(2
days prior), and in the middle of the night, she rolled over and
struck her head on a board associated with a drawer next to her
bed, which was apparently reinforced with metal. She felt the
impact immediately, but did not lose consciousness. The next
day,
she felt tired and was sleeping much more than usual. She also
recalls that the next night, she rolled over in bed and AGAIN
bumped her head against the board, as well as her arm. She is
not
sure where in her head she had the injury.

Her son, who lives at home with her, states that he was not
aware
of her hitting her head, but has certainly noticed her sleeping
more than usual in the past 2 days. Normally, he works during
the
day time and sleeps in his own room at night, and she is
extremely independent with her ADLs, so he does not pay a lot of
attention to her. However, he also noticed that she seemed more
confused than usual; for example, when they were watching TV
together and he pointed out an interesting program, she seemed
to
not know where the TV was located. She also walked towards the
bedroom when trying to get to the bathroom, which required him
to
guide her over. She also seemed to be using the wall and
furniture to help with walking, when typically, she is
completely
independent in ambulation. He denies any language difficulties
or
any slurred speech.

Due to her confusion, her son brought her to Lisafort ED for
evaluation. There was some concern that she should have fallen out
of bed and hit her head, but the patient clarified that
headstrikes were while in bed, however these were not witnessed
so report could not be confirmed. Noncontrast head CT showed a
right occipital lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Neurosurgery
was consulted who felt that the imaging finding was not
consistent with traumatic hemorrhage and therefore asked for
Neurology to admit the patient.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, blurred vision, diplopia,
dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or
hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech. Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills. No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No
dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

IMAGING:
CXR 2025-02-05:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT HEAD 2025-04-19:
Large 4 cm right posterior parietal acute intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with
associated surrounding edema and compression of the posterior
horn of the
right lateral ventricle.. No definite midline shift.

CT HEAD 2025-04-19:
No significant interval change to the right parieto-occipital
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with vasogenic edema. Unchanged
degree of sulcal and right posterior horn effacement. No new or
enlarging hemorrhage.

MRI AND MRA BRAIN 2025-06-05:
1. Study is moderately degraded by motion.
2. Allowing for difference technique, grossly stable right
occipital
intraparenchymal hematoma compared to 1 day previous noncontrast
head CT.
3. Within limits of study, no definite mass associated with
right occipital hematoma. Please note that underlying mass is
not excluded on the basis of this examination. Recommend
follow-up imaging to resolution.
4. Probable postsurgical changes compatible with patient's known
left frontal meningioma resection and craniectomy, as described.

5. Artifact limits evaluation of right M 2 and distal middle
cerebral artery branches, which are noted to be grossly patent.
6. Otherwise, within limits of study, grossly patent circle of Brainstem with no definite evidence of AVM or large aneurysm
identified.
7. Limited imaging of cervical spine suggests degenerative
changes with at
least mild vertebral canal narrowing at C4-5. If clinically
indicated,
consider cervical spine MRI for further evaluation.

theta/delta activity reaching a maximum of 7 Hz. A moderate
amount of low-voltage frontally predominant beta activity is
present. There are occasional Normal generalized suppressions.
There are rare bifrontal sharp-and-wave discharges. Of note,
the patient is off EEG from 23:19 to 03:26.

SLEEP: Structured sleep architecture is not present.

PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are no pushbutton activations.

SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are numerous automated spike
detections capturing the bifrontal sharp-and-wave discharges
reported above, and various nonspecific transients and
artifacts.

SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are numerous automated seizure
detections for various artifacts. There are no electrographic
seizures.

QUANTITATIVE EEG: Trend analysis is performed with Persyst Magic
Marker software. Panels include automated seizure detection,
rhythmic run detection and display, color spectral density
array, absolute and relative asymmetry indices, asymmetry
spectrogram, amplitude integrated EEG, burst suppression ratio,
envelope trend, and alpha delta ratios. Segments showing
abnormal trends are reviewed, and show the findings as described
above.

CARDIAC MONITOR: A regular rhythm at 80-100 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring study because of
(1) rare bifrontal sharp-and-wave discharges, consistent with
bifrontal cortical irritability; and (2) generalized background
slowing consistent with a moderate-severe encephalopathy,
nonspecific with regard to etiology. There are no pushbutton
activations or electrographic seizures.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Williams is a 2005 old woman with history of T2DM not on
insulin, HTN and left frontal meningioma s/p resection in 1973
complicated by osteomyelitis and craniectomy as well as
perioperative seizures, now seizure free who presented to BI on
2025-08-05 with lethargy and mild confusion found to have a right
parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

#RIGHT PARIETO-OCCIPITAL IPH:
Patient's initial exam was notable for disorientation,
inattention, perseveration, paraphasic errors, left homonymous
hemianopia, left pronator drift and mild left sided weakness
with a left upgoing toe. CT scan showed a large 4 cm right
posterior parietal acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
associated surrounding edema and compression of the posterior
horn of the right lateral ventricle without midline shift.
Follow-up MRI brain did not show an underlying lesion, but was
obscured by blood products. She was admitted to the stroke
service where her SBP was maintained below 150. She also
underwent 3 days of continuous EEG recording, which did not show
any evidence of seizure, only focal slowing.

Her neurologic exam improved during the hospitalization and she
was ultimately A&O x 3, mildly inattentive with a left
homonymous hemianopia.

Etiology of her symptoms was thought most likely secondary to
cerebral amyloid angiopathy given the location of the bleed and
history of cognitive decline. There was some mention of minor
head trauma prior to this event, but this was not thought to be
the etiology given the appearance of the bleed on imaging.

She should avoid aspirin and antiplatelets in the future. Primary care doctor
recommended rehab.

Transitional issues:
N/A avoid aspirin, antiplatelets

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Williams,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of confusion and
difficulty seeing resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to
the brain begins to bleed. The brain is the part of your body
that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so
damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can
result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke.
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk
factors. Your risk factors are:
-high blood pressure
-diabetes
-cerebral amyloid angiopathy

We are changing your medications as follows:
-STOP Aspirin

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur,
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your Cleveland Health Institute Neurology Team

Chest pain Complaint:
Status post PVI complicated by a pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary Vein Isolation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 1973 yo male with longstanding h/o atrial
fibrillation and atrial flutter s/p afib ablation x 1, and
aflutter ablation x 2 and multiple failed cardioversion attempts
who was admitted today for a pulmonary vein isolation procedure.
During his last admission, he underwent cardioversion and
initiation of dofetilide and anticoagulation. After discharge,
he went back into afib, despite dofetilide, therefore it was
determined that he should undergo PVI.

Today, he underwent PVI, and intially there was no evidence of
pericardial effusion prior to procedure. A post procedure
echocardiogram showed evidence of a 0.9 cm effusion anterior to
the RV, without any echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Post procedure, the patient was hemodynamically stable, in sinus
rhythm, chest pain free, and was admitted to the CCU for further
monitoring.

On admission to the CCU, the patient denies any chest pain or
shortness of breath. He denies significant groin pain. He is
otherwise without complaints.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, syncope or presyncope. He was experiencing
palpitations at home when he went into afib.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
TEE 2025-05-31:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast but no thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
and left atrial appendage. No spontanous echocontrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The interatrial septum is intact by 2D, but there is
a small color Doppler jet in the superior portion of the
interatrial septum c/w ASD with left-to-right flow. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta 45 cm to the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild mitral regurgitation and trace
tricuspid regurgitation are seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild spontaneous echocontrast without evidence of
thrombus in the left atrium and left atrial appendage. Small
secundum type atrial septal defect with left to right flow at
rest. Simple plaque in the descending thoracic aorta.

2025-03-29 10:53 AM
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

2025-03-29 13:00
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is a small (~1cm), primarily anterior
pericardial effusion around the right ventricle (seen on
subcostal views). There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-04-08, a
small pericardial effusion is now identified.

TTE (2025-07-02):
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-04-08, there is no
significant change.

2025-02-28 EP STUDY: (prelim)
The results were as follows:
Normal pulmonary vein flow velocities (0.4-0.6m/s) and the
absence of pericardial effusion at baseline were documented by
intracardiac echo.
1. The baseline rhythm was AF with variable rate.
2. The left atrium was entered by a double transeptal approach
using a 20G needle advanced through two transseptal
sheaths under intracardiac echo guidance. Much difficulty was
encountered during the transseptal papproach with suspivion of
pericardial space entry rather
than the East Nicole. Ultimately, with the aid of TTE, the entry of the
Foley 16 Fr was verified by pressure measurements Diastolic pressure 18 mm
Hg, RA pressure 16 mm Hg). Heparin 8500u IV bolus followed by
2200u/hr gtt was then administered and adjusted for ACT>250s.
3. A 10 pole variable lasso catheter, a 10 pole non-variable
lasso catheter, and an 4 mm Biosense cooltip ablation catheter
were used for Electrophysiology study and RF ablation. All four pulmonary
Thrombosed were identified. Endoscopic was performed using both Cut-down
and Cut-down. RFA of all four pulmonary veins was performed during
CS pacing but was not comleted due to
the pericardial effusion and difficulty catheter positioning.
Burst pacing from the CSl induced sustained AT/AF originating
from the East Nicole. Additional lesions around the PVs and roof region
did not terminate the tachycardia. Ultimately, 20J shock was
internally delivered to convert the pt's rhythm to normal
rhythm. At the end of the procedure, the patient was extubated,
and the catheters removed. Once the ACT was less than 180ms, all
of the sheaths were removed. The patient was transferred in
stable condition to the PACU for post-procedure observation, to
be followed on the floor
overnight.
General anesthesia was administered, and appropriate monitoring
performed, by members of the anesthesia staff. The patient
tolerated the procedure well and left the laboratory in good
condition.

Conclusions
1. Unsuccessful PVI
2. Percardial effusion post-PVI

Brief Hospital Course:
1973 yo male with atrial fibrillation with previous afib and
aflutter ablations and multiple DCCV which has been unsuccessful
admitted today for a pulmonary vein isolation procedure
complicated by small anterior pericardial effusion.

# Pericardial effusion: The patient developed a small
pericardial effusion about 1 cm in size during a pulmonary vein
isolcation procedure. He had a TTE later the day of the
procedure which showed that the effusion was stable and without
echographic signs of tamponade. Another TTE the day after the
procedure showed again that it was stable without signs of
tamponade. The patient had slight peluritic chest pain which
gradually resolved over the course of his hospitalization.

# Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of afib and
aflutter status post many medication trials and interventions
without lasting response. Most recently the patient was on
dofetilide but converted back to afib. He underwent a PVI which
was not fully completed given the development of a small
pericardial effusion during the procedure. He remained in the
hospital a few days after his procedure as his medications were
changed to try to attain rate control his atrial fibrillation.
He had a few episodes of a.fib with RVR while the medication
changes were made. His metoprolol was increased and he was
discharged on 100 mg metoprolol XL daily. He was started on
diltiazem and was discharged on 180 mg nightly. He was also
started on digoxin and was discharged on 0.25 mg daily. His
dofetilide was stopped. His warfarin was held initally for the
procedure and was restarted for anticoagulation for his a.fib.
He was discharged with Holter monitor of Hearts monitor and will follow
up with Dr. Mark Mayo as an outpatient.

# Hypertension: The patient remained normotensive and was
acutally slightly hypotensive as the AV nodal blockers which
being titrated for rate control of his atrial fibrillation. His
lisinopril was stopped given his low pressures and was not
restarted on discharge. He was instructed to discuss restarting
it will his primary doctor once he was stabilized on a
medication regimen for his atrial fibrillation.

Discharge Instructions:
You are being discharged from the hospital after admission for
an cardiac ablation of your pulmonary veins in an attempt to
eliminate your atrial fibrillation. Unfortunatly, it does
appear to have been successfull in controlling your symptoms.
We will attempt to control your fibrillation with rate control,
and have increased your metoprolol and have started 2 new
medications called Digoxin and Diltiazem. You should stop
taking your dofetilide. There was some concern of increased
fluid around your heart following the procedure, which is
stable. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain,
palpitaitons, or lightheadedness, you should call your
cardiologist or go to the emergency room.

You should resume your comadin and regular monitoring as
previous.

The following changes were made to your medications:
Stop taking Dofetilide
Start taking Digoxin at 0.25mg by mouth every morning
Start taking Metoprolol XL 100mg by mouth every morning
Start Diltiazem 360mg by mouth, 212 tablet every evening
Stop Lisinopril until instructed by your doctor to restart this
medication. It was stopped due to low blood pressure.

You have received Holter monitor of Hearts monitor and need to follow
instructions for transmitting this information to Dr.
Mark Mayo.

You can take Ibuprofen for your chest pain. You should watch
for any stomach upset. You should take Omeprazole 20mg by mouth
a day to prevent stomach irritation and ulcers. If you notice
any bleeding in your bowel movements, you should stop taking
ibuprofen and come to the emergency room immediately.

Chief Complaint:
""Today was the first time I had psychosis""

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
""Briefly, Michael Davis is a 2020 year old PhD post-doc at Michael Harding with
no prior medical history and a psychiatric history notable for
anxiety (including OCD and skin picking), depression (unclear
unipolar vs. bipolar), and prior delusional thought content who
is in treatment for ADHD and depression and has no history of
psychiatric hospitalizations or suicide attempts who presents
today with symptoms concerning for psychosis.

On interview, Michael Davis states that earlier today she noticed that
she felt like her thoughts starting to become ""weird"". She
closed her eyes and saw people with pink hair on their faces
which was distressing to her. She felt like she could take other
people's perspectives which was unusual, and was convinced that
the Manager at her coffee shop did not like her for an unknown
reason to her. She found these symptoms to be very distressing
and she spoke with her friend, who is an Internal Medicine physician, who
recommended she go to the Cleveland Health Institute for an evaluation. In Romerohaven, Michael Davis
started obsessionally reading the news and was worried about the
world ending with the news at the time. She thought about bomb
shelters and she was very convinced that the world was ending
while others around her weren't as fazed. She states that this
happened during a few weeks during her PhD and she returned home
to Tammystad and her symptoms resolved. She states that she thinks
she has been under increased stress at work and has had more
difficulty sleeping, which she believes along with her
stimulants may be contributing. She denies other experiences
similar to these. She denies any excessive use of her Adderall
or bupropion or any ilicit drug use.

She states that her mood is ""tired"" and ""depressed"". She
describes feeling hopeless and experiencing hypersomnia, and
does have some passive suicidal thoughts without any intent or
plan. She also describes having ""masochistic thoughts"", though
has difficulty elaborating on this. She describes recently
experiencing some elevation of her mood where she felt very
giddy and grandiose about getting an idea published in JAMA,
though this lasted for a day. She describes fluctuation in her
mood, though has difficulty prescribing a clear narrative of her
symptoms. She spends most of the interview focusing on what
these symptoms mean for her and what treatment could mean on her
record. She also focuses on having trouble at work, not
performing well, and falling behind.

She denies any HI, auditory hallucinations, current IOR, thought
broadcasting, or thought insertion. ""

On interview, the patient continues to endorse all of the above.
Additionally, when asked what brought her to the emergency room,
the patient gave a very tangential account beginning with not
being able to sleep on Friday night for multiple reasons to how
a therapist's inability to characterize her romantic
relationship with a previous boyfriend as abusive, leading to
further trauma endured by the patient at the hands of her now
ex-boyfriend. Continued to endorse multiple stressors Recent surgery
falling through, her employment being ""up in the air,"" and a
""transcendental experience where she knew ""everyone was judging
her as selfish and lazy."" Continues to endorse distressing
images perceived when eyes are closed, of ""pink hairy faces.""

Reports that she first started buproprion toward the end of her
PhD in an effort to obtain better focus. She felt it worked
well, but had a psychiatrist who, per her report decided to stop
the medication and switch to Lamictal, which she disliked.
""Lamictal slowed my brain down."" When she was switched back to
buproprion, she felt it did not work as well as it did in the
past, leading her to a trial of Adderall. Over time, she has
self modulated her dose of Adderall depending on how she felt
while taking it. ""Adderall was jarring. Sometimes it was too
much, and when it builds up I feel manic and anxious. And
sometimes it wouldn't be as good, so I would take it
intermittently."" In addition to the at times 60mg daily of
Adderall ER, she would also consume anywhere from 47 cups of
coffee per day.

Reports poor sleep, anhedonia, decreased interests in hobbies,
decreased ability to concentrate, little appetite, though denies
weight loss. Endorses ruminating thoughts, and heart
palpitations mostly associated with adderall consumption.
Endorses periods of elevated mood lasting for a day or two,
which she described as ""hypomanic."" Endorses OCD sx as above.
When asked what she thinks her symptoms are due to, she states,
""I think it's mostly stress induced, mixed with meds that are
stimulating, and no sleep, but I also think my mental health has
been getting worse over time.""

While she endorses passive suicidal thoughts such as, ""It
wouldn't be that bad if all of this was because of a brain
tumor,"" she denies active ideation, intent or plan. Denies
HI/AH, thought insertion or projection. Endorses paranoia as
above. Denies sx of PTSD.

Reports she is able to come to unit staff should she have an
inclination to harm herself or others.

Upon readying ourselves to leave the treatment room, the patient
turned back to try to stop the faucet from dripping, stating,
""It was really bothering me.""

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level
throughout their admission. She was also placed on 15 minute
checks status on admission and remained on that level of
observation throughout while being unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Anxiety with Obsessional Traits
As per HPI, patient reported worsening anxiety in the setting of
relationship and work stressors, increased stimulant use,
caffeine use, poor sleep. She also endorsed intrusive thoughts,
paranoid thoughts, and delusions that she could read other
people's thoughts. Given that patient experienced similar
symptoms several years ago (which abated after returning home
briefly and adhering to a more regular sleep schedule),
patient's current presentation appeared most consistent with an
acute anxiety exacerbation and intensification of obsessional
behaviors in the setting of precipitating factors listed above.
Patient was in agreement with recommendation to discontinue home
stimulant, and she expressed desire to taper Wellbutrin.
Additionally, patient provided informed consent to trial of
risperidone for intrusive thoughts and heightened anxiety, which
patient tolerated without side effects. Dosing on discharge was
0.5mg PO QHS and 0.5mg PO BID PRN anxiety with good effect.
Ramelteon was also started at 8mg PO QHS PRN insomnia. Patient
reported reduction of anxiety symptoms, improved sleep, and
improved mood. She continued to have eye tic which was unchanged
at time of discharge, but was bothering patient less.

Medications stopped on this admission
- Wellbutrin
- Adderral

Medications started on this admission
- Risperdal 0.5mg PO BID PRN anxiety and 0.5mg PO QHS
- Peter York 8mg PO QHS PRN insomnia

If patient develops worsening anxiety or depressed symptoms,
discussed possibility of starting Effexor. Patient had poor side
effects with lexepro (lethargy, amotivation) and was not
interested in starting another SSRI.

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Patient denies substance abuse. Team discussed importance of
avoiding marijuana, stimulants, and caffeine, given symptoms.
Patient in agreement with plan.

4. MEDICAL
#) No medical issues identified

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching
patients various coping skills. Patient was friendly, engaged,
and visible in the milieu.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
Craig Contreras (friend and Internal Medicine physician- Company A) She has
known her for a long time. She has always been a little odd but
overall able to function and relatively successful in her work.
Yesterday, she seemed ok during the day but later started
texting her c/o hallucinations and concerns she might be
psychotic which is unusual for her. Yesterday was a difficult
day at work because her boss was getting fired.

Molly Rice MD Gastroenterology- Main campus Updated on
patient's status and discussed treatment goals.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for,
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of
starting Risperdal medication, and risks and benefits of
possible alternatives, including not taking the medication, with
this patient. We discussed the patient's right to decide
whether to take this medication as well as the importance of the
patient's actively participating in the treatment and discussing
any questions about medications with the treatment team, and I
answered the patient's questions. The patient appeared able to
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon
worsening anxiety with psychotic symptoms. Their static factors
noted at that time include chronic mental illness, feelings of
hopelessness, singe status, and high stress level at work. The
modifiable risk factors were also addressed at that time.
Patient worked on coping skills in group therapy and through
yoga on the unit. She was set up with outpatient therapist and
PCP. Risperdal helped reduce patient's racing thoughts and
delusional thought content. Discontinuing wellbutrin and
stimulant helped with patient's anxiety. Finally, the patient is
being discharged with many protective risk factors, including
good social supports, employment status, gender, coping skills,
outpatient providers, and Cooperative behavior. Patient
demonstrated preserved capacity to engage in a meaningful
discussion about safety planning about what she would do in the
event of worsening symptoms of anxiety or heightened distress
(e.g. patient would contact her outpatient providers, call +917651839065,
or present to the emergency department). Based on the totality
of our assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CABGx1 (LIMA-LAD), MVR Bioprosthetic 23 mm tissue valve Mitral valve repair

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Thompson is a 1989 year old female with a history rheumatic
heart disease. In 1984, she was admitted to Columbia Asia Hospital in for acute diastolic heart failure after presenting
with several days of increasing shortness of breath. This was
her
second episode of heart failure requiring diuresis. She was
diuresed with intravenous lasix with good effect. An
echocardiogram at that time (Per note only, no formal
report)demonstrated moderate mitral stenosis with a valve area
of
1.2, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid
regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency, normal ejection
fraction of 60-65%, mild Inferior hypokinesis, mild left
ventricular hypertrophy, mild left atrial enlargement and
moderate pulmonary hypertension with a systolic PA pressure of
40-50mmHg. A cardiac catheterization was performed this August
which showed moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis with increased
gradient and decreased cardiac output response to exercise.
Single vessel coronary artery disease was also noted. Given her
symptoms and the severity of her disease she was seen by Dr.
Samuel Schmidt in August for surgical discussion. A repeat transthoracic
echocardiogram was performed in August which showed mild mitral
stenosis, moderate regurgitation and characteristic rheumatic
deformity of the mitral valve leaflets. Only trivial tricuspid
valve regurgitation was noted.

Past Medical History:
1. Rheumatic heart disease with moderate mitral stenosis and
regurgitation. Moderate TR, mild Aortic insufficiency.
2. CHF requiring hospitalization 1984 and 1984. Mild COPD
4. Hyperlipidemia - not currently on any medication

Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate valvular
mitral stenosis (area 1.3cm2). The mitral regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe 3+ reflex tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid annulus in not dilated (2.8 cm) There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. Crystal Perez was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is AV paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. There is a well seated
bioprosthesis in the mitral position. The leaflets display
normal motion. There is no appreciable mitral regurgitation
seen. At a cardiac output of about 4 liters/minute the maximum
gradient across the mitral valve was 14 mmHg with a mean
gradient of 7 mmHg. The tricuspid regurgitation appears
significantly improved - now mild to moderate. The rest of
valvular function is unchanged. The thoracic aorta is intact
after decannulation

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on 2025-01-03 where
the patient underwent CABG x 1, MVR (tissue) with Dr. Crystal Perez.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
She left the OR in complete heart block. EP was consulted and
recommendations made. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably. She was in sinus rhythm
by POD 2. The patient was neurologically intact. Beta blocker
was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight. The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication. The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility. Daniel Rowe of Hearts monitor was arranged for
discharge. This will be followed by Dr. Check blood pressure at home twice daily and maintain a log.. By the time of
discharge on POD 6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The
patient was discharged to South Alyssa at Oncology Department Rehab in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions. She is not
discharged on a statin, as she is allergic.

RADIOLOGY
========================
C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA X RAY (2025-02-15)
IMPRESSION:

Degenerative disease with severe narrowing of C4/5 and C5/6.
Mild
retrolisthesis of C4/5 is likely degenerative in nature. No
suspicious
lucencies or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST (2025-02-15)
IMPRESSION:


1. Innumerable apical predominant micronodules in a random
distribution most
consistent with an acute infectious process. A variety of
infectious agents
could cause this appearance including atypical infectious
processes such as
tuberculosis, bacterial bronchopneumonia or fungal etiology.
Differential
diagnosis may also include asthma or viral infection.
2. Inferior left lower lobe consolidation may represent
atelectasis, with a
component of infection unable to be excluded.
3. Small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions bilaterally.
4. Patulous esophagus, suggesting dysmotility.
5. Please see separately submitted Abdomen and Pelvis CT report
for
subdiaphragmatic findings.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/CONTRAST (2025-02-15)
IMPRESSION:


1. Mild circumferential wall thickening and stranding of the
urinary bladder,
concerning for cystitis. Correlate with urinalysis.
2. Polycystic liver and right kidney is described.
3. Small volume perihepatic ascites.
4. Please see the separately submitted report of the same day CT
Chest for
findings above the diaphragm.
LIVER/GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND (2025-02-15)
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis.
2. Polycystic liver and kidney disease, although kidneys are
not well
assessed on this study.
3. Stable splenomegaly measures 18 cm.

Chest X RAY (2025-02-15)
IMPRESSION:

Increased opacification in the left lower lobe which may reflect
infection or
atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions and persistent
elevation of
the left hemidiaphragm.
RENAL ULTRASOUND (2025-02-15)
IMPRESSION:


1. Patent renal vasculature.
2. Normal intrarenal resistive indices ranging from 0.61-0.75.
Similar
appearance of the intrarenal waveforms with tardus parvus
morphology, grossly
unchanged as compared to renal transplant ultrasounds 2025-02-03 and 2025-03-29
3. The main renal artery is normal with a peak systolic velocity
54.4
centimeter/second, previously 68.9 centimeters/second on 2025-04-18.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Cook is a 2007 year old man with end-stage renal disease
secondary to polycystic kidney disease status post kidney
transplant 2025-06-01, frequent
urinary tract infections, benign prostatic hyperplasia status
post transurethral resection of the prostate with intermittent
straight cath at home, recurrent C. difficile infection, who
presented with five days of fever and chills, found to have
sepsis secondary to E. coli bacteremia with probable urinary
source.

ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
============================
#Sepsis Secondary to E. coli Bacteremia
Patient presented on 2025-08-11 with fever and chills, febrile to
100.6, with concern for infection in the setting of
immunosupression, and started on empiric ceftriaxone and flagyl.
On 2025-01-22, blood cultures grew gram negative rods resistant to
ceftriaxone, and the patient was transitioned to ceftazidime.
Blood cultures subsequently speciated with pan-sensitive E.
coli, and the patient was transitioned to oral ciprofloxacin on
2025-01-29. The source of infection was initially unclear based on
patient symptoms and was evaluated with chest X ray, cervical
spine X ray, chest CT, CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast,
urine studies, and C. difficile studies. Based on the patient's
history of recurrent urinary tract infections, blood culture
speciation with pan-sensitive E. coli, and bladder wall
thickening on CT, his bacteremia was likely secondary to a
urinary tract infection, although this is not definitive given
the absence of symptoms and negative urinalysis. Low suspicion
for pulmonary source given absence of symptoms and culture
speciation with E. coli, but given CT chest findings and
continuing immunosuppression, the patient was evaluated to
rule-out tuberculosis with three acid-fast bacillus stains.
Given the absence of a definite source of infection, Mr. Cook
would likely benefit from outpatient evaluation for source with
a tagged WBC scan. Following antibiotic therapy for his E. coli
bacteremia, the patient improved clinically and has remained
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Subsequent blood cultures
have shown no growth to date.

#ESRD Autosomal recessive PKD s/p LURT
The patient was continued on his home immunosuppression regimen
with tacrolimus and prednisone, with daily monitoring of
tacrolimus levels. His renal function remained stable during
this hospitalization.

#Recurrent CDI
The patient was continued on his outpatient suppressive regimen
of oral vancomycin for recurrent C. difficile. His stool was
negative for C. difficile antigen.

#Thrombocytopenia
Patient presented with thrombocytopenia with platelets decreased
to 89 on admission likely secondary to sepsis, subsequently
improved to 164. Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic at
baseline in setting of splenomegaly and polycystic liver
disease.

#Hyponatremia
Patient hyponatremic to 130 on admission, likely in setting of
vomiting, asymptomatic. He received 1L NS in ED. Sodium
subsequently returned to within normal limits.

CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES
============================
#Prostate cancer
#Urinary retention
#BPH s/p TURP 2025-05-20: The patient underwent intermittent straight
caths, and was continued on his home tamsulosin.

#Tophaceous gout
The patient was continued on his home allopurinol.

#Prothrombin gene mutation c/b DVTs and pulmonary embolism
The patient was continued on his home warfarin, with close
monitoring of his INR in the setting of

#HTN:
The patient was continued on his home metoprolol succinate.

#HLD:
The patient was continued on his home atorvastatin.

#Anxiety:
The patient was continued on his home venlafaxine.

IMAGING:

CT HEAD 2025-06-02: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in size of left basal ganglia acute hematoma with mild adjacent mass effect and slight effacement of the left ventricle but no significant shift of normally midline structures. Correlate clinically for HTN; while this is most likely to be HTN, an underlying lesion cannot be completely excluded. Further workup to be as clinically indicated.

CXR 2025-06-02:
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with mild vascular congestion.

ECHO 2025-06-02:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Diana Villa is a 1973 year-old right handed man w/ PMHx of poorly controlled DM, HTN and heavy alcohol use who presented initially to University College Hospital London and then was transferred to Riverbend Medical after 2 days of dysarthric speech, with BP on arrival 235/85, requiring multiple agents to control, and a head CT showing a left basal ganglia hemorrhage.

# NEURO: Patient's neurological exam remained stable and then improved to only very mild R facial droop and very mild dysarthria. We held his aspirin while he was an inpatient, with plan to restart it 1 week from the onset of symtoms. He will start taking 81mg ASA again on 2025-05-26. He was restarted on Amanda Allen 72 hours after the onset of his symptoms, and his neurological exam remained stable.

# CARDS: Patient's BP was very difficult to control, so he was started on a diltiazem gtt, which was effective. He was also started on lisinopril 20mg QD while here for BP control. The dilt gtt was able to be weaned off on the night of 2025-02-09, but the next morning was still elevating intermittently to the 190's. He was put on hydralize for BP >160. We obtained a TTE, which was unremarkable. He was then increased to lisinopril 40mg QD and started on amlodipine which was uptitrated to 10mg QD. His BP was then finally well controlled in the 140's.

# PULM: Patient's admission CXR showed some mild vascular congestion, but patient was symptomatic throughout this admission. His lasix was initially given at 20mg BID, but was then increased to 60mg QD on 2025-02-09.

# ENDO: His HgA1C was 10.1. His finger sticks were routinely elevated to the 200's. While here, he was put on 60 units of lantus QAM and an insulin sliding scale. On further investigation, it was determined that he actually takes levemir 60 units BID. He was also recently prescribed novolog 10 units Qbreakfast, 20 units Qlunch and 10 units Qdinner, but has not yet picked up this Rx. We transitioned his long-acting insulin to be BID prior to dispo. We also sent him home with instructions to take the novolog as prescribed by his NP, James Roberts.

Attending: Sheila Crawford.

Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Richard Roman is a 1992 female with history of
idiopathic drop attacks, HTN, COPD not O2 dependent, and 2025-04-15 diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary to the
brain s/p craniotomy and currently on cyberknife treatment who
presents with chest pain.

THe patient states she has been having chest pain off and on for
past several months. But in the last 24 hours it has become
progressively worse and severe. The pain is currently, and has
always been, in the right upper chest radiating into the axilla,
sharp, stabbing, comes in waves. Not worse with palpation. No
dyspnea associated with it. She denies any cough or fever. No
headache, N/V, diarrhea, abd pain otherwise.

She reportedly has history of iodine ?contrast allergy in past.
However she cannot recall this. She says she has allergy to
barium contrast before, which causes constipation.

Of note on 2025-06-13 she was sent to ED from Simpsonside for dyspnea,
but this resolved on arrival, so she was sent home.

Patient was seen by new PCP Isaac Jones on 2025-06-13. The patient
is now still waiting for her initial medical oncology and
palliative care appointment (for pain mgmt).

ED: received 40 mg IV solumedrol at 1:30 AM for CTA study
premedication

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
-She began having unprovoked episodes of falling 2025-02-09. She
underwent further workup by Pulmonology Neurology in 2025-06-13 with
MRI/MRA,
EEG, and cardiac workup. On 2025-06-13 she presented with
lightheadedness and underwent NCHCT that was significant for
left
parieto-occipital brain lesion, edema and midline shift. She
underwent craniotomy with neurosurgery on 2025-06-13.
-During admission, CT Scan of Chest was obtained to further
investigate lung mass viewed on Chest-xray. Results showed Large
right upper lobe mass penetrates the chest wall toward the
axilla and destroys the first and second ribs and is concerning
for lung primary rather than secondary neoplasia. Thoracic
surgery was consulted and recommended no intervention as long as
tissue would be obtained from the brain mass.
-Brain biopsy reveals metastatic adenocarcinoma, although stains
nondiagnostic for primary site.
-2025-06-13 The brain MRI from shows a total of 6 lesions in
addition
to the cavity. She begins cyberknife treatment.

CTA CHEST

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality.
2. Re-demonstration of 9.0 cm right upper lobe mass with
invasion of the chest
wall destruction of the right second and third ribs similar to
prior.

CT head


1. Status post left parietal craniotomy and resection with
interval
development of encephalomalacia in the resection cavity.
Evaluation for
recurrence in this region is limited on the current modality and
better
assessed with contrast enhanced MRI.
2. Subtle hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe, likely
corresponding with the
known metastatic lesion seen on prior MRI from 2025-06-28.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Richard Roman was initially admitted with chest pain; a CTA chest
showed no PE, but demonstrated right rib infiltration from her
CA. Her EKG and troponin were likewise not suggestive of
ischemia. Her pain was very pleuritic, and localized over the
rib lesions -- therefore, this was most consistent with cancer
pain. Her symptoms were also dramatically improved after having
a large bowel movement. Her pain was well controlled with her
home dose of oxycodone. She received a single dose of radiation
for her brain metastases while she was an inpatient, and was
placed on a dexamethasone taper as described below. Overall, she
had not been doing well at home -- falling, having difficulty
taking medications. She was evaluated by Pulmonology and OT, and
discharged to a Home.

History of Present Illness:
Blake Calhoun w/ PCKD, stage III NSCLC with brain mets s/p 4 cycles of
Altima/Cisplatin, s/p cyberknife, with recent discontinuation of
crizotinib and recent start of Xeloda presents with RUQ
pain. She states this started roughly 1.5 weeks ago and is worse
with any movement, even coughing. The pain is mitigated somewhat
at rest. It is located over the right ribcage and flank. She has
had no hematuria or dysuria and has been urinating normally. She
also notes that she has had some intermittent fevers which have
been occurring for weeks and are not clearly associated newly
with this pain. She also has ongoing nausea and vomiting which
had been worse with the crizotinib and continues now. No
hematemesis. No severe headaches. She notes a mild cough worse
over the past few days but otherwise no rhinorrhea. Pt reports
h/o kidney stones 30 years ago with somewhat unsuccessful
lithotripsy though had no subsequent issues with symptoms from
this standpoint until now.

Note pt was recently discharged 2025-03-09 after hospitalization for
nausea/vomiting/dehydration. Her crizotinib was stopped. She
received IVF and her 1.5 mg/dL noted on admission improved with
creatinine down to 1.1 by discharge. She was seen subsequently
in
Johns Hopkins Clinic clinic 2025-03-09 by Dr. Paula Bond prescribed Brian Houston at
600mg
per day (relafen 750) in hopes she would tolerate this. She was
supposed to come back for re-evaluation in a few weeks. She has
been taking this medication daily.

In the ED her vitals were stable but she initially had a temp of
101 on arrival which went down to the high 98 range
subsequently.
Labs were pertinent for UA with small leuks, 19 WBC, few bact and
1 epi. No nitrites. She had Moderate impairment with BUN/creatinine 0.8 mg/dL. CT
torso performed which was unremarkable except for a 5mm
nonobstructing kidney stone. Thsi was done without contrast. She
received 1L IVF, 1g CTX, and IV morphine which did provide good
pain relief.

At the time of this interview she is ambulating from the bathroom
and continues to feel fatigued and the rib/flank pain continues
but she is able to get around. Describes pain as up to 10/10 (worst imaginable pain) when
most severe. She has no nausea/vomiting currently but feels
chilled and reports feeling very cold. Denies urinary symptoms.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
GENERAL: + fever/chills as above, + recent weight changes (weight
loss)
HEENT: No sores in the mouth, painful swallowing, intolerance to
liquids or solids, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea, or congestion.

PSYCH: No feelings of depression or anxiety. All other review of
systems negative.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Pt presented to her PCP with pleuritic chest
pain on 2025-03-09. Pt states this was in the setting of a viral
illness. A CXR was done and it showed pna vs lung mass and
d-dimer was positive, so a CTA chest was pursued. This showed no
PE, however, there was a large spiculated RUL mass 4.3 x 3.7 x
3.1 cm. There was also a smaller pleural based mass and bulky
lower LAD in the chest. She was subsequently seen by Thoracic
Surg then by IP, who performed bronch and biopsies. The path
returned as adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin. She has had a
PET CT as well as MRI brain which do not indicate distant mets.

In review of her PET CT scan during the thoracic-oncology
conference, there was some question as to whether there might be
focal PET avidity in her distal thoracic spine. Thus, a thoracic
MRI was done on 2025-03-09 which did not show any definite
evidence of tumor. There was noted subtle signal abnormality in
the distal thoracic spine T10 through T12, but as described
findings were questionable and subtle and most likely represent
some degenerative change. Thus, pt proceeded with original plan
of chemotherapy and radiation.

- 2025-03-09 started radiation, last treatment 2025-03-09
- 2025-03-09 C1D1 Alimta/Cisplatin
- 2025-03-09 C2D1 Alimta/Cisplatin
- 2025-03-09 C3D1 Alimta/Cisplatin
- 2025-03-09 C4D1 Alimta/Cisplatin

- 2025-03-09 PET-CT showed decrease in size and FDG avidity of
right upper lobe primary lung carcinoma and nodal metastases in
the mediastinal, hilar and right level VI lower cervical node
stations.
- 2025-03-09 CT torso showed right upper lobe lung cancer and
intrathoracic lymphadenopathy similar to 2025-03-09 PET-CT, but
substantially decreased in size when compared to the pretreatment
chest CT.
- 2025-03-09 CT torso showed progressive radiation fibrosis, stable
infiltrative mediastinal lymphadenopathy and stable appearance to
abdomen and pelvis with no evidence for any metastatic disease.
- 2025-03-09 CT torso showed overall stable disease, but mentions a
possible new soft tissue nodule in the third and fourth
intercostal space posteriorly adjacent to a small loculated
pleural effusion. There is also expected evolution of
post-radiation changes in the lungs bilaterally.
- 2025-03-09 PET-CT showed that primary right upper lobe tumor has
decreased in size and FDG-avidity and there was increased
radiation-induced scarring and traction bronchiectasis in the
right upper lobe and new milder scarring in the left upper lobe.

All mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastases demonstrated good
response to therapy. There was however a new 17 x 11 mm region
of FDG-avidity superior to the left kidney, which could represent
a new left adrenal metastasis but alternatively could be a pocket
of urine or an inflammed cyst.
- 2025-03-09 MRI head (performed bc pt had a fall and sustained a
head injury in 2025-03-09 revealed two subcentimeter enhancing
metastatic foci, in the right temporal lobe and right cerebellar
hemisphere.
- 2025-03-09 MRI head showed the same lesions, a bit bigger
- 2025-03-09 had Cyberknife treatment to the lesions
- 2025-03-09 PET-CT showed mild increase in size and avidity of the
right upper lobe nodule as well as mediastinal and hilar lymph
nodes. Also, 1.1 cm lesion superior to the left kidney has
significantly increased in avidity, concerning for a left adrenal
metastasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Blake Calhoun w/ PCKD, stage III NSCLC with brain mets s/p 4 cycles of
Altima/Cisplatin, s/p cyberknife, with recent discontinuation of
crizotinib and recent start of Brian Houston who presents with
RUQ and right flank pain found to have 5mm nonobstructing kidney
stone (stone present on imaging from 2025-03-09 as well). Most likely
this is actually cystic pain due her underlying cystic
liver/kidney disease. Not thought to be an infected stone by
urology. Pt's initially had pyuria with urine culture growing
vaginal flora. Treated with ciprofloxacin x 7 days to complete
on 2025-03-09. Pain control with MS 1977. Stable post-dialysis improved with IVF
and good PO intake (1.8 -> 1.3).

=============
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============

# UTI -Pt initially had fever (to 101 in ED) and positive UA,
although there was no obstruction/hydro on imaging, and urine
culture grows vaginal organisms unlikely to cause significant
disease. However, treated on basis of fever and pyuria with 7
day course of ciprofloxacin 2025-03-09.

#nonobstructive nephrolithiasis: Pt noted to have 5mm
nonobstructing stone in lower pole of right kidney. As per
urology, as the stone is nonobstructing, it is unlikely to be
causing pain, and there is no acute intervention other than
fluids, which she received.

# Acute Kidney Injury - likely Sepsis very poor PO intake as she
has been struggling with this in the setting of cancer
treatments. GI adverse effects with Brian Houston may also be
contributing. She has been admitted before with Sudden Cardiac Arrest due to
volume depletion. In absence of hydronephrosis/obstruction on
imaging, the kidney
stone is not likely the source of the elevated creatinine. Pt
was treated with fluids with improvement in Creatinine from 1.8
to 1.3.

#Right flank pain: Pt reported severe right flank pain. Unlikely
due to nonobstructing stone, and ultrasound did not show
hydronephrosis. GIven her extensive polycystic liver and kidney
disease, a ruptured or infected cyst may be the etiology of her
pain. She was treated with morphine and was discharged on a home
PO morphine regimen.

#stage III NSCLC with brain mets - s/p chemotherapy and most
recently progression on crizotinib now on Brian Houston. Known brain
mets. Pt stated during this admission that she did not want to
continue with Brian Houston due to adverse effects. She discussed
her plans with outpatient oncologist and decision was made to
defer treatment for 2 weeks and reassess at next outpatient
visit. She would likely benefit from a lower dose.

#Coagulopathy: likely in the setting of poor PO intake.

=============
CHRONIC ISSUES
=============

# Hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine

# Depression - contined sertraline

=============
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=============

- Will need monitoring of her Cr given 1.5 mg/dL on presentation
- Will need to complete 7 day course of Cipro for UTI (to
complete on 2025-03-09)
- Will need to follow up with Dr. Paula Bond further
chemotherapy and pain control (started MS 1977 on this
admission)

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. Blake Calhoun,

You were admitted due to pain in your right flank. You were
found to have a small (5mm) kidney stone lodged in your right
kidney, which did not appear to be causing any obsruction or
blockage. You were seen by the Urology team and they felt that
this was unlikely to be the cause of your pain and did not feel
that you would benefit from further Urologic interventions. You
had a fever so we treated you with antibiotics. You should
complete a seven day course of Cipro, which should end on
2025-03-09. You were also dehydrated and had an elevation in your
creatinine (1.8), which was 1.3 on your day of discharge. You
should have this followed up with your PCP/oncologist.

It was a pleasure being part of your care,
Your Emergency Medicine team

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 2018 year-old female presenting with watery diarrhea
for the past 3 weeks and worsening abdominal cramping, diarrhea,
and poor PO intake over the last several days. She reports that
she has been having more than ten bowel movements a day. She
states that she has only had 1 day during which she noticed some
light blood streaks mixed with the stool. In addition, when the
diarrhea began, she did notice some mucousy bowel movements.
Initial workup by the PCP showed normal CBC, BMP, liver function
tests, and thyroid studies, as well as negative urinalysis and
stool cultures/ova and parasite/Clostridium difficile tests.
She was recently seen by GI in the clinic on 2025-01-28, who
determined that her symptoms may be consistent with a viral
syndrome or early inflammatory bowel disease. She was started
on immodium, BRAT diet, and plans were made for elective
colonoscopy. Beginning 5 days ago, symptoms began to worsen and
patient became more nauseous with very little PO intake, diffuse
abdominal cramping, and worsening diarrhea. She states that her
symptoms seem to worsen with drinks with a lot of sugar, such as
apple juice and gatorade.
.
She presented to the ED today with worsening abdominal cramping
and loose stools. Initial vitals in the ED were T 100.2 HR 80
BP 134/73 RR 22 O2sat 100% RA. She received 2 L NS, IV Zofran,
and Cipro/Flagyl in the ED. CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis
showed colitis in the descending and sigmoid colon. Melissa Lee saw the
patient and stated that there was no need for an acute
colonoscopy due to inflammation. Patient denies any
fever/chills at home, recent travel, sick contacts, weight
changes, dizziness, syncopal episodes, chest pain, SOB,
vomiting, dysuria, leg swelling, or skin changes.
.
On the floor, patient's initial vitals were T 96.7 HR 70 BP
132/63 RR 18 O2 sat 97% RA. She was still having abdominal
cramping and profuse diarrhea.

CT SCAN ABD/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1. Colitis affecting the descending and sigmoid colon as well as
the rectum. The differential includes infectious versus
inflammatory colitis - ischemic colitis is much less likely.
2. Diverticulosis.
3. Lumbosacral scoliosis and degenerative changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 2018 year-old female presenting with watery diarrhea
for the past 3 weeks and worsening abdominal cramping over the
last several days.
.
#. Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea: Two most likely etiologies are
inflammatory bowel disease and bacterial/viral colitis. Patient
with no risk factors for infectious etiologies, such as recent
antiobitoic use, travel, sick contacts and stool cultures have
been negative. Ongoing nature of symptoms makes inflammatory
disease more likely given these lack of risk factors. Ischemic
colitis also a possible etiology caused by low flow state from
long-term diarrhea. Patient was started on IV cipro/flagyl and
kept on bowel rest for the first 2 days of her stay. She was
also given IVF hydration. She had a colonoscopy on Day 3, which
showed generalized colitis and a small polyp which was removed.
Biopsies were taken. By Day 4, patient was tolerating full POs
and her abdominal and diarrhea had improved. She was discharged
on PO Cipro/Flagyl for a total of a 1:1 with GI
follow-up. Stool cultures were negative or pending by the time
of discharge.

History of Present Illness:
Jerry Gonzales with history of aortic stenosis/mitral stenosis, vascular
dementia and schizoaffective disorder who initially presented to
Oncology Department with right sided chest pain and shortness of breath.
She was sent from her nursing home where HR was noted to be 47
on routine vital signs. She was normotensive with HR in the 90â100 bpm (normal sinus rhythm),
but became bradycardic and EKG showed complete heart block in
the 90â100 bpm (normal sinus rhythm). She was given atropine and for progressive hypotension,
was started on levophed. She was also given calcium and a right
femoral CVC was placed. She was transcutaneously paced and sent
to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ED.

In our ED, initial VS were T 97.9F, HR 90 paced, BP 119/60 on
levophed, SpO2 97% on NRB. The pacer was turned off and her
intrinsic HR was 55 on norepinephrine. Given bradycardia, she
was started on dopamine, and admitted to ICU.

=========IMAGING/STUDIES=================
2025-06-24 ECG
Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of
2025-05-29 no
change.

2025-06-24 ECG
Atrial tachycardia with complete heart block and slightly wide
ventricular
escape in the 90â100 bpm (normal sinus rhythm). Compared to the previous tracing the rhythm
is now atrial
tachycardia.

ECHO 2025-08-04
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is a possible mobile
echcodensity/vegetation (vs. artifact) on the LVOT side of the
aortic valve (clip 4). There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The leaflets are
poorly defined and a vegetation cannot be excluded. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is mild functional
mitral stenosis (mean gradient 13 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. The mitral chordae are thickened with a 0.7mm
mobile echodensity on the chordae c/w a possible vegetation
(clips 28, 30, 31) - thought atypical for location being on the
ventricular side of the valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] No masses or
vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal
image quality. Possible vegetation on the aortic valve leaflets
with severe aortic valve stenosis. Possible vegetation on the
mitral valve chordae. Functional mild mitral stenosis due to
MAC. Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-04-15,
the aortic and mitral valve abnormalities/possible vegetations
are similar (clips 6 for aortic valve; clip 86 for mitral valve
chordae).
A TEE would be better able to assess mitral valve morphology and
severity of mtiral regurgitation, but may not provide better
visualization of the subvalvular apparatus and aortic valve due
to acoustic shadowing.

CTA chest 2025-04-14 IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic
abnormality.
2. Interval placement of bilateral pleural pigtail drainage
catheters with near complete resolution of bilateral pleural
effusions, now trace.
3. Small right anterior pneumothorax.
4. Improved aeration in the bilateral lower lobes with mild
residual
atelectasis.
5. Scattered areas of reticular interstitial opacities in the
bilateral upper lobes suggestive of viral or atypical
infections, as before.
6. Unchanged severe centrilobular emphysema, bulky mediastinal
and hilar
lymph nodes.
7. Cirrhotic liver right perihepatic ascites.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis 2025-02-07 IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
2. Diffuse anasarca in the setting of cirrhosis with moderate
ascites, free
fluid in the pelvis, and new bilateral pleural effusions.

CXR 2025-01-28 IMPRESSION:
In comparison with the study of 2025-06-20, the monitoring and
support devices
are stable. Continued low lung volumes. There is increasing
opacification at
the right base, consistent with substantial atelectasis in the
right middle
and lower lobes with persistent pleural effusion. Less marked
effusion
atelectasis on the left.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there again is a
moderate
pulmonary vascular congestion.

CTA head/neck 2025-02-24 IMPRESSION:
1. Dental almalgam streak artifact limits study.
2. Likely subacute to chronic infarcts involving the bilateral
frontal
cortices. Left temporal lobe encephalomalacia consistent with
chronic
infarction. Findings are relatively unchanged. No evidence of
hemorrhage.
3. Patent intracranial vasculature.
4. Atherosclerosis of bilateral cervical carotid arteries
without significant
stenosis by NASCET criteria.
5. Intraluminal calcification within the proximal left
brachiocephalic artery
without definitive residual intraluminal contrast filling, which
may
represents complete occlusion versus severe stenosis. The more
distal
brachiocephalic and subclavian arteries are patent, possibly via
retrograde
flow from the left vertebral artery.
6. Severe emphysema at the lung apices with heterogeneous
parenchymal
ground-glass and interlobular septal thickening in the setting
of moderate
bilateral pleural effusions. Findings likely represent
pulmonary edema,
however infectious process is possible in the appropriate
clinical setting.
7. Dental Hepatic Failure (Liver Failure) involving the right maxillary canine tooth.
Recommend
nonurgent follow-up with dental evaluation.
8. Please note MRI of the brain is more sensitive for the
detection of acute
infarct.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Veins 2025-01-31
There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation of the
bilateral
common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. Limited
evaluation of the calf veins bilaterally demonstrates color flow
of the posterior tibial and peroneal veins upon augmentation.
There is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral
veins bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:
Limited evaluation of the calf veins bilaterally, but no
evidence of deep
venous thrombosis in the right or left lower extremity veins.

Left Upper Extremity Vein US 2025-01-31
There is normal flow with respiratory variation in the bilateral
subclavian vein. The left internal jugular and axillary veins
are patent, show normal color flow and compressibility. The left
brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins are patent, compressible
and show normal color flow and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left
upper extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
Jerry Gonzales with a PMHx notable for HTN and DMII presenting from her
nursing home with dyspnea, chest pain, and found to be in
complete heart block, now s/p pacemaker placement.

# COMPLETE HEART BLOCK: The patient was found to be bradycardic
to the 90â100 bpm (normal sinus rhythm) with normal BP. She was sent to Oncology Department, where she was
found to be in complete heart block. The patient became
progressively hypotensive and was started on norepi with
transcutaneous pacing and transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. On arrival to
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the patient was noted not to be capturing appropriately
from transcutaneous pacing. She was started on dopamine and
levophed for BP support. ECG on arrival to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center showed
alternative BBB consistent with infranodal AV conduction
disease. A temporary wire was attempted to be placed on the
night of admission, but wire was unable to be advanced via R IJ
access. The patient was treated with permanent dual chamber
pacemaker on 2025-02-14 and was successfully weaned of levophed. CXRs
were monitored without evidence of significant PTX. The
patient's home diltiazem was held in the setting of bradycardia.
Discharged home on metoprolol succinate 50 mg QDOf note, blood
pressures were asymmetric in the left and right arms, with the
left being 20 mmHg lower. Therefore, she underwent CTA to r/o
aortic dissection. Therefore, ALL BPs SHOULD BE TAKEN IN RIGHT
ARM GIVEN SUBCLAVIAN STENOSIS ON L SIDE.

# SEPSIS: The patient presented with leukocytosis. CXR was
concerning for PNA. UA was initially suggestive of infection,
but UCx only grew alpha hemolytic strep and lactobacillus. The
patient was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone and flagyl for
HCAP/aspiration pneumonia for which she completed a 7 day
course. later in her hosptial course, she started spiking dialy
fevers. Main concern was for a pacemaker wire infection, however
TEE was deferred as, per EP team, pt would not be a candidate to
have her PPM replaced. Subsequently, pan culture data continued
to be negative and therefore abx were discontinued, and she
remained afebrile. Therefore, fever likely a drug fever. N/A

# PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: Pt developed hypoxemia and required
supplemental oxygen. Noted to have large b/l pleural effusions
on CT chest. Likely secondary to volume overload as a result of
ICU course and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.9). Underwent
thoracentesis and fluid analysis confirmed transudative
effusions. Afterwards, was diuresed with IV lasix boluses,
escalated to lasix gtt, and eventually converted to PO
torsemide. Presenting weight 62.8 kg to 52.3 on discharge, with
BNP 13k -> 2k. Oxygen requirement resolved, and discharged home
on Torsemide 100 mg PO QD for euvolemia/slow gradual diuresis
for ascities as detailed below.

#Ascites/cirrhosis- hx of cirrhosis per EMR. CT abdomen
confirmed cirrhosis and moderate ascites, therefore likely Acute Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)
hypoalbuminemia and portal hypertension. Unable to resolve
ascites with above regimen, therefore continued on torsemide 100
mg PO. Of note, Hector Bright was consulted for therapeutic paracentesis,
however no safe entry point was identified. On discharge, pt
asymptomatic and abdominal distention much improved.

#Anemia - CT abdomen ruled out retroperitoneal bleed.
Subsequently, stool guiac positive, therefore pt with likely low
grade GIB (Retic index 0.7 therefore no acute blood loss, coags
and haptoglobin wnl therefore DIC/intravascular hemolysis
unlikely, but iron studies consistent with iron deficiency
anemia: Fe 34, TIBC 215, Ferritin 91). Transfused a total of 2 u
pRBCs, with appropriate compensation, and discharged home with
Hgb 9.1. Consider iron supplementation as outpt and/or GIB
work-up.

# THOMBOCYTOPENIA: Pt with plt drop from 233 on admission, to
270 on 2025-07-14 to 129 on 2025-07-14. Likely underlying deficit in
production given cirrhosis, however may have been exacerbated in
setting of sepsis. Subsequently improved later in hosptial
course. Platelets 184 on day of discharge.

# DM II: Continue long and short acting insulin, which was
titrated to meet needs.

# Schizoaffective Disorder: Continued Lexapro and divalproex.

=======TRANSITIONAL ISSUES=============
-ALWAYS MEASURE BP IN R ARM AS KNOWN SUBCLAVIAN STENOSIS ON
LEFT!
-Home diltiazem stopped. Now on metoprolol succinate 50 mg QD.
Please monitor for HR/BP.
-Started on torsemide 100 mg PO to maintain euvolemia and
hopefully have gradual improvement of ascities. Please check
CHEM-7 and supplement potassium as needed and monitor Cr. Cr on
discharge 0.8. Weight on discharge 52.3 kg.
-Hx of cirrhosis. Adjust medication dosage need spironolactone/Lasix for maintenance
therapy for ascites in future.
-Stool guiac positive and studied consistent with iron
deficiency anemia, therefor may have low grade GIB. Consider
supplemental iron vs outpt work-up for GIB. Transfused 2 u
pRBCs over hospital course. Hemoglobin 9.1 on discharge.
-New diarrhea towards end of hospital course. C.diff negative x
2. Improving on discharge, however this needs to be monitored to
make sure it eventually resolves.
-Dental caries: found in right maxillary canine tooth
-Please redicuss code status. Code was reversed for procedure x
24 hrs, but pt remained full code through remainder of hosptial
course and on discharge. As per discussion with guardian, pt is
to be full code if she decompensates, but with time trail (~7
days) on life sustaining treatment N/A

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Gonzales,

You came to the hospital because you were having chest pain and
felt short of breath. When we looked at the electrical activity
in your heart, we saw that your heat was beating very slowly and
therefore resulting in you having these symptoms. When your
blood pressure dropped significantly, you required electrical
pacing of your heart, as well as special medications to
stimulate its pumping. Afterwards, you had a permanent pacemaker
placed to help keep your heart pumping, therefore were able to
have these special medications taken off. Additionally, you
received 1 unit of blood to help stabilize your body during this
time. Last, there was concern you had an infection in your
bladder (or lungs) so you received a few days of antibiotics.
For the last part of your course, we were simply trying to
remove all of the excess fluid in your belly. This may of been a
result of all the fluids you got during the hospitalization or
simply a result of your underlying liver disease. On discharge,
it is important you take your water pill torsemide 100 mg (1
tablet) everyday in order to keep the fluid from building up-
please follow up with your PCP as he/she will determine how long
you will need to be on this pill.

We wish you the best of luck,
-Your Royal Free Hospital care team

History of Present Illness:
In summary, patient is a 1993 yo lady found kneeling in the
bathroom with AMS by building manager who called EMS. She had no
records on her, no family with her, 2015 speaking.
.
In the ED, vitals 98.2 58 144/77 20 99% RA. Her exam was WNL,
said that the was Respiratory Failure and that she was in Lake Dustin. She had
enlarged ventricles on head CT. She received 1L fluid with
vitals to 98.3 72 160/69 12 100% RA. She had ST depressions on
V4-V6 but enzymes flat and no CP. UA WNL. She received aspirin.
.
On the floor, patient reported wrist pain, throat pain, urinary
frequency and constipation but no chest pain. Denied shortness
of breath or cough. Patient did not know where she was or why
she had come to hospital. All communicated through On-site interpreter translator. EMS information not included in chart so do not know
where she came from as patient didn't know. Lives in Houston, TX but could not recall phone
number.
.
In the morning, we contacted patient's building manager to get
in touch with patient's daughter. We received medical records
from Paper chart. Patient says that she took
a pill of ambien (she normally doesn't take any or only takes
half), and two pills of homeopathic, unknown sleeping pills. She
denies chest pain, palpitations, HA, parasethesias, prodromal

Brief Hospital Course:
1993 yo lady found kneeling in the bathroom with AMS by Hospital
manager who called EMS s/p taking ambien and two sleeping pills.

# AMS: Patient's altered mental status had resolved by the time
the primary team spoke with her in the morning. Etiology of
patient's complaints was Chemotherapy drug side effect after taking
zolpidem 10 mg and she has underlying dementia. Unlikely stroke,
hemorrhage - no focal neuro findings; CT with enlarged
ventricles but no incontinence or ataxia to suggest NPH.
Electrolytes and infectious w/u were negative. Per her daughter,
patient was at her mental status baseline upon discharge.
.
# Ecchymoses on wrist: Likely Septic Shock due to Pneumonia to fall. Wrist x-ray was
obtained that was negative for fracture. Patient and family told
that if pain and swelling persist to follow-up with PCP for
repeat imaging. She should ice intermittently for 20 minutes and
use tylenol for pain.
.
# ST depression on EKG: Stable; comparison with prior EKG
obtained from PCP was similar. Patient was ruled out for MI and
had no events on telemetry.
.
# Hyperlipidemia, HTN: We continued home medications.

Pt is a 1983 with h/o CVA with residual aphasia and paralysis,
dementia, GERD, HTN who presents from her nursing home with a
blocked G-tube. Patient is non-verbal at baseline, but per
report, her tube had been working well up until last night at
about 8PM. She was receiving feedings through the tube at that
time. However, her tube becamse clogged and they were unable to
use it. She otherwise was in her usual state of health without
any obvious complaints.

Past Medical History:

GENL: awake, non-verbal, moans otherwise
HEENT: NCAT, no scleral icterus, dry mucous membranes
Neck: supple, no LAD
CV: RRR no m/r/g distant heart sounds
Lungs: CTAB anterior/lateral, difficult to assess due to pt's
inability to cooperate, no wheeze or crackles
Abd: moderately distended, G tube projecting outwards with scant
drainage, c/d/i. + BS, Pt moans with deep palpation in bilateral
lower abdomen.
Rectal exam: no hard stool in rectal vault
Ext: 1+ edema bilat, extremities warm, right arm in splint
Neuro: moans, unable to cooperate with exam

Pertinent Results:
Labs: CBC, Chem panel WNL. See below
Imaging:
KUB 2025-03-08: No evidence of obstruction or ileus, with
gastrostomy tube overlying the upper mid abdomen.
G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK 2025-07-15: Prelim- Contrast injected through
the gastrostomy tube, with opacification of the stomach and
proximal small bowel loops, without evidence of extraluminal
contrast.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, T 97, HR 86, BP 142/71, RR 16, 97%RA. Her tube was
flushed with coke and ginger ale without effect. Because of
this, she was admitted for definitive management.
.
# Blocked G-tube: When pt was in radiology for a G-tube check
x-ray, radiologist was able to inject contrast material through
the G-tube with ease. It could be that soaking the G-tube with
Coke and Ginger ale may have unblocked it. G-tube was in its
proper location by x-ray, and KUB did not show evidence of
obstruction of ileus. Tube feeds (""Replete with fiber"" brand, as
Jevity 1.2 is not available in this hospital) were started,
titrating to goal of 70cc/hr, and pt tolerated it well. Pt was
at her goal at the time of transfer.
.
# Abdominal distension: Pt did appear to have moderately
distended abdomen (not sure of baseline) but exam remained
stable over two days. Pt's abdomen should be carefully examined
and followed to monitor any changes that may require work-up.
.
# Mental status: Pt was alternating between alertness and
drowsiness throughout her stay in the hospital. This may
represent hypoactive delirium, although we cannot be certain.
Pt's mental status should be followed carefully for any changes.
.
# Inactive issues: CVA, Anxiety/Depression, Vascular dementia,
Hypertension - pt was continued on her regular medication
regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because your G-tube stopped

Ginger ale did not work, however, after several hours of
soaking, the G-tube started to function properly again. We made
certain with x-rays that your G-tube remained in the right place
and that you did not have any obstruction in the bowels.
.
We would like you to take Lansoprazole Liquid instead of
Omeprazole, since Omeprazole cannot be crushed for G-tube
administration. Please resume all the rest of your medications
that you have been taking.
.
If you experience another blockage of G-tube, fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/enlargement, please call your
primary care physician or return to the emergency room.

Final Report
INDICATION: Back pain radiating to chest, evaluate for
dissection.

COMPARISON: No relevant comparison available.

TECHNIQUE: Volumetric multidetector CT acquisition of the chest
was performed
before and after administration of 100 mL Optiray intravenous
contrast and
displayed in the axial plane with 5- and 2.5-mm collimation
respectively.
Coronal, sagittal and bilateral oblique reformats were obtained
for
evaluation.

CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Minimal atherosclerotic
calcifications are
seen in the normal caliber thoracic aorta without evidence of
intramural
hematoma or dissection. Pulmonary arterial vasculature is well
visualized to
the subsegmental level without filling defect to suggest
pulmonary embolism.
No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, axillary or hilar lymph
nodes are
present. The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within
normal limits
aside from moderate coronary artery calcifications in the LAD
and right
coronary artery. There is a trace pericardial effusion and trace
left pleural
effusion. No right pleural effusion. A partially imaged
hypodensity in the
anterior thyroid may be a crossing vessel or thyroid nodule.
There is a
moderate sized paraesophageal hiatal hernia.

Lung window images demonstrate no focal consolidation aside from
mild
bibasilar dependent atelectasis. Multiple ground-glass pulmonary
nodules are
seen (2:19, 2:29, 2:33), the largest measuring 6 mm in the left
lower lobe
(2:35) and 6 mm in the right middle lobe (2:31). Airways are
patent to the
subsegmental levels bilaterally.

The study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. There
is
cholelithiasis without gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic
fluid. A 1.4
x 2.1 cm fat-containing hypodensity in the upper pole of the
right kidney is
most likely an angiomyolipoma. A 2.9 x 2.9 cm right renal simple
cyst is
noted.

BONE WINDOWS: No lytic or sclerotic lesion suspicious for
malignancy is seen.
No acute fracture is identified. A non-aggressive-appearing
sclerotic lesion
in the vertebral body of T2 is likely a bone island.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
2. Multiple bilateral pulmonary ground-glass nodules, the
largest measuring 6
mm. Followup with dedicated chest CT is recommended in 12 months
if patient
has no risk factors for malignancy. If patient has risk factors
for
malignancy, followup with dedicated chest CT should be performed
at Adhere to fluid restrictions to avoid fluid overload.
months.
3. Coronary artery atherosclerotic calcifications.
4. Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
5. Partially imaged hypodensity in the anterior thyroid may be a
crossing
vessel or thyroid nodule. Correlate clinically and if indicated,
nonemergent
thyroid ultrasound can be performed for further evaluation.

Cardiac Catheterization 2025-04-03 (preliminary report)
40% non flow limiting lesion of RCA, otherwise normal

ECHO 2025-01-03
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Phyllis Moreno is a 1973 y/o F with history of hiatal hernia and
GERD, no known CAD history, who is presenting with chest pain.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
Chest pain: Mrs Phyllis Moreno presented with chest pain and <1mm
ST elevation in an inferolateral distribution. Repeat EKG showed
resolution of the ST segment changes but non-specific t wave
changes. She was admitted and monitored with telemetry which
later showed ST elevations. A repeat EKG was performed which
confirmed >1mm ST elevations inferolaterally. She was taken to
the cath lab which showed 40% non-obstructing lesion in the RCA
and no suggestion of clot formation. Her EKG showed persistent
ST elevations despite her catheterization. Cardiac enzyme were
repeatedly performed throughout her admission which remained
negative. It was felt that her EKG changes probably represented
coronary vasospasm. She was started on diltiazem and was
discharged on 180 mg daily. Because of her new CAD she was also
started on full dose aspirin and simvastatin 10mg. A beta
blocker was not started because her blood pressure was low
normal and felt to be too low to also start now in addition to
the diltiazem. Differential diagnosis considered for her
presentation included pericarditis as she reported the pain to
be pleuritic and improved with sitting forward, and the STE
persisted despite lack of pain and normal cath. As treatment of
this would be with aspirin or nsaids it was assumed that
increasing her dose of aspirin may help.

Coronary artery disease: Though this was not felt to be the
cause of her pain, the lesion noted represents a new diagnosis
of CAD. She was started on simvastatin and full dose aspirin. A
beta blocker was not initiated at this visit because of the
concurrent initiation of diltiazem.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Mrs. Phyllis Moreno has low normal blood pressure at baseline prior
to initiating diltiazem. Her BP should be closely monitored and
signs of low BP or orthostasis were explained to her.

Consideration of a Beta blocker for her coronary artery disease
should be considered in the future but at this time was defered
because of her BP.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Phyllis Moreno,

He were in the hospital because He were having chest pain. We
believe the pain was caused by a spasm in your coronary artery.
We started He on a medication called diltiazem to decrease the
spasm in your artery. We also started He on a medication for
your cholesterol and increased the dose of your aspirin.

MEDICATION CHANGES SUMMARY:
Please START diltiazem long acting 180 mg daily
Please START simvastatin 10 mg daily
Please INCREASE aspirin from 81 mg daily to 325 mg daily.

Thank He for coming to the General City Hospital Garciaview. It was a pleasure taking care of He.

A CT scan showed an abnormal area in the anterior thyroid.
Please follow-up with your primary care provider regarding He thyroid ultrasound.

Followup Instructions:
Start the prescribed medication and do not miss any doses."

Attending: Keith Galloway.

Chief Complaint:
Oral pain, abdominal pain, decreased po intake

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 2023 year old man with a PMHX of HTN, chronic
pancreatitis, chronic back pain, osteoporosis and a history of
EtOH abuse (up until 03:53 PM - 07:19 PM year ago) who is S/P tooth extraction x5
approximately 2 weeks ago. Since that time, he has not been able
to eat due to swelling of his gums and pain. He has been
intermittently drinking liquids, but not taking his home
medications and feels very dehydrated and weak.

Roughly 1 week ago, he noted the onset of non-bloody vomiting
and diarrhea. His abdominal pain is ""different than
pancreatitis"" that he's had in the past. He reports some relief
of his pain when lying prone. He is unable to characterize the
abdominal pain well, but says it is diffuse and sharp, without
radiation.

He also reports back pain, with weakness in the arms and legs,
which is chronic for him. He also reports headache and shortness
of breath, which he cannot characterize. He endorsed recent
weight loss, but with difficulty in quantifying.

He denies fevers or having taken recent antibiotics.

Upon review of OMR, it appears that Mr. Freeman has seen his PMD
for abdominal pain since 2025-01-20, with multiple no-shows
and telephone interactions. He saw a gastroenterologist in
2025-01-20 for refractory GERD as well as abdominal pain. To
evaluate the abdominal pain, GI recommended high resolution MRCP
to fully evaluate the pancreas; was started on Creon for
pancreatic enzyme supplementation. There is no record of MRCP
performed at Harveychester after this point. For refractory GERD, his
PPI was increased to 40 mg BID, he was extensively counseled
about dietary modifications and repetition of an EGD (last was
at 2025-01-20? - no record).

In the ED, initial vitals were: 123/71 mmHg 98.6 110 bpm (tachycardia) 16 100% on
RA. Vitals prior to transfer were 123/71 mmHg 97.9 98 165/100 18 98% RA.

In the ED, EKG showed sinus rhythm at 112 bpm, NANI, without
STE. CBC was significant for WBC of 20.5, HCT 56.5, platelets of
295. Chemistries significant for bicrbonate of 16, with an anion
gap of 20, creatinine of 1.3 (baseline 0.8-1.2 recently) and a
lactate of 2.5. LFTs and urinalysis were pending.

CT of the abdomen & pelvis was performed which showed sequela of
chronic pancreatitis, unchanged from 2025-01-20. No evidence for
superimposed acute pancreatitis. Chronic findings include fatty
liver, renal cysts, atherosclerosis and diverticulosis. CXR
showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.

He was started on ampicillin/sulbactam for concern for possible
dental infection and sent to the floor.

On the floor, he endorses severe abdominal pain (0/10 (no pain)), enough
to bring the patient to tears.

Past Medical History:
Chronic pancreatitis, h/o EtOH abuse - currently drinks on
weekends, 268 drinks
PTSD, anxiety
HTN
Lupus anticoagulant
- Hx of renal infarct in left kidney (2025-01-20)

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 2023 year old man with a PMHX of HTN, chronic
pancreatitis, chronic back pain, osteoporosis and EtOH abuse who
is S/P tooth extraction x5 approximately 2 weeks ago who
presents with the inability to eat/close the mouth secondary to
swelling and pain.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: Mr. Freeman endorses the onset of abdominal
pain 1 week ago accompanied by nausea, non-bloody vomiting and
diarrhea. Due to dental instrumentation 2 weeks ago, he's had
oral pain and difficulty maintaining po intake, including home
medications. He endorses feeling slightly more bloated than
usual. CT Abd/Pel showed sequelae of chronic pancreatitis,
without evidence of acute on chronic pancreatitis. Stool studies
for culture, O&P, C. difficile and guaiac were not able to be
sent since the patient had a few BMs while here and disposed of
them before RNs could send. Analgesia was achieved with
hydromorphone and MS 5/5 - Normal muscle strength. GI was consulted to see the patient
and felt conservative management, hydration, analgesia, stool
studies and follow up with GI as outpatient.

# ERYTHROCYTOSIS: Resolved. The patient reports a history with
some question of a red blood cell disorder, perhaps polycythemia
primary polycythemia, that was diagnosed at Harveychester. Upon review of records, it
appears the patient has lupus anticoagulant. Heparin was used
for prophylaxis.

# GUM SWELLING: Mr. Freeman had mild erythema of the upper
gums, without pus or discharge. He endorses pain over the area
as well, which has made po consumption difficult. He has been
afebrile, but does have a leucocytosis to 20.5, which could
indicate infection. He received Unasyn and was transitioned to
Augmentin. Dental saw him and requested that OMFS see him - they
recommended to obtain consultation with oral surgery to evaluate
maxillary anterior region. After discharge need to have upper
left bicuspid extracted and have full upper denture fabrication.
OMFS saw the patient and recommended full liquid diet, Peridex
rinse QID and encourage good Oral Hygiene.

# DEHYDRATION: In the setting of gum swelling and pain after
tooth extractions as well as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea for 1
week. On exam, the patient appears somewhat dry. He received IV
hydration and was slowly able to increase po intake on his own.

# HTN: Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was hypertensie
to 147/106, but appeared to be in pain. Analgesia and home
medications were continued and his BP normalised.

# CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: perhaps pain related to chronic
pancreatitis, although no evidence for this on CT abdomen.
Patient's symptomatology pointed to a possible pancreatitis
(epigastric pain, radiating to back, nausea, pain relieved in
prone position). Home Creon was continued. Will follow up with
GI as outpatient.

INACTIVE ISSUES
# OSTEOPOROSIS: continue weekly alendronate at home. No
bisphosphonate was given during hospitalisation for concerns of
refractory GERD.

# CHRONIC BACK PAIN: At home, the patient reports taking
hydromorphone 4 mg po qAM and qPM, as well as MS 5/5 - Normal muscle strength 100 mg
po once daily, despite being prescribed for MS 5/5 - Normal muscle strength 100 mg
bid. He reports attempting to cut back on the amount of opiates
he's taking, in conjunction with his PCP. Analgesia was
provided.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Should see Cognitive Neurology - concerned about decreases in
memory
- Sleep study for ? history of OSA
- Follow up with GI for EGD/H. pylori testing
- Follow up with dentistry at Harveychester - will be contacted for
appointment, if not, please call +917334050582

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Freeman,

You were admitted to Mount Sinai Medical Center for oral pain and abdominal pain with
diarrhea and difficulty eating and drinking after extraction of
teeth. You were also very dehydrated as the result.
As we discussed during your hospital stay, your CT scan showed
that a significant part of your pancrease has been damaged by
chronic inflammation. The pancrease is responsible for producing
digestive juices and certain hormones, including insulin.
Currently, you are on Creon, which acts like the digestive
juices produced by normal pancrease and help you digest the food
you eat. It is important for you to take Creon with meals to
help you absorb the nutrients you eat, prevent weight loss and
vitamine deficency.
While there is no effective way to cure your chronic
pancreatitis, it is important to prevent more damage. Avoiding
alcohol is the single MOST important treatment. We understand
that the alcohol helps you deal with chronic pain, however, it
is very bad for your pancreas and will cause you more pain in
the future. The pain of chronic pancreatitis may also be reduced
by eating small and low-fat meals. It is also very important for
you to drink plenty of water. Without enough water, you may
become dehydrated again and cause more damage to your pancrease
and other organs, such as your kidneys.
Stop drinking alcohol and eating smaller amount of food each
time may also help with your reflux and prevent damage to your
stomach. To avoid weight loss, you can eat the same amount of
food, just a little bit at a time.
Overall, please stop drinking alcohol all together, eat low fat
food, take Creon with food and drink plenty of water.

Thanks for letting us care for you,
- Your team at Mount Sinai Medical Center

Chief Complaint:
thrombosed AVG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hip replacement left upper arm AVG


History of Present Illness:
Adult female gentleman with chronic kidney disease, who has
previously
undergone placement of a left forearm AV graft in 1989. Has
had increasing problems with venous outflow. However, he did
not require initiation of hemodialysis until earlier this
week. For that reason, once the graft thrombosed it was
never maintained. The decision was made to proceed with a
left upper arm graft once he needed to initiate dialysis. He
initiated dialysis via tunneled hemodialysis catheter earlier
this week, and is electively taken to the operating room
today.

Brief Hospital Course:
On 2025-08-07, he underwent left upper extremity arteriovenous
graft. Surgeon was Dr. Adrienne Goodwin. Please refer to operative
note for complete details. A block was used by anesthesia. His
arm was placed in a sling postop.

Postop, he did well with positive left radial pulse and thrill.
Dressing remained dry without drainage or bleeding. His forearm
appeared quite ecchymotic. The block wore off with only his left
thumb feeling numb.

Hemodialysis was performed on 2025-08-07 without problems via the
right chest tunneled line. 2 liter were ultrafiltrated.

Post, HD, he did have moderate pain in the incision despite
receiving Tylenol. Oxycodone 2.5mg was given with good relief of
pain.

He felt well enough to go home with his sister with whom he
lives. Emergency services were resumed and he will continue outpatient
HD and adult day care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Griffin arrived via helicopter to Johns Hopkins Clinic on 2025-08-15 with a
ruptured AAA. He was taken emergently to the CT scanner and then
directly to the Operating Room. He underwent an open repair of
his ruptured aneurysm with a tube graft. The abdomen was left
open with Abthera in place. For full details of the procedure,
please refer to the separately dictated Operative Report.
Massive transfusion protocol was activated during the case and
he received a total of 12 prbc, 2 plt, 2 cryo, 26 FFP, 250
albumin, 1400 CellSav, 2L NS, and 2L LR intraoperatively. He
was left intubated and brought to the cardiovascular ICU in
critical condition. Upon arrival to the CVICU, he had large
volumes of bloody output from the Abethera (>3.5L in 6 hours),
and persistent transfusion requirement which prompted early
re-exploration of the abdomen on 2025-05-31. No discrete bleeding
was identified and it was felt that bleeding was due to
coagulopathy. He was again brought to the CVICU for re-warming
and correction of coagulopathy. Abthera output subsequently
slowed and he transfusion requirement drastically decreased. On
2025-07-29, given the fact that no pedal signals were appreciated
bilaterally and his lower extremities were looking more mottled
and there was clinical concern for compartment syndrome, the
patient was taken back to the OR for b/l BK popliteal cutdowns,
embolectomy and fasciotomies. Given patient's significant loss
of domain, ACS was consulted to help with abdominal closure, for
which they placed a Whitmann patch on 2025-04-14 with subsequent OR
take backs for washout & tightening until closure was obtained
on 2025-05-07.

During the patient course he underwent the following operations:

The details of the Patient is alert hospital course are discussed by
system below:

Neuro: Patient remained sedated as appropriate while he was
intubated. He was awakened periodically for neuro exams and was
able to follow commands and respond with head nod to questions.
Patient was extubated on 2025-05-11 and was conversant and
continued to follow commands. The patient required reintubation
on 2025-01-27 hypoxia, but continues to follow commands when
sedation is weaned to check neuro exam. He required intermittent
reintubations due to his respiratory status, but his
neurological status remained intact. He remained neurologically
stable during admission.

CV: Patient has required levophed since his initial procedure to
maintain MAPs >60. Patient developed new onset Afib on 2025-03-12
for which an amiodarone gtt was started and then transitioned to
scheduled amiodarone doses. Patient independently cardioverted
to NSR and remained in NSR for the remaining duration of his
stay. Vascular medicine recommends he should continue on his
current metoprolol regimen.

PULM: Patient returned to Johns Hopkins Clinic ICU intubated after initial open
repair. Patient remained intubated until 2025-05-11, when he was
extubated to high flow nasal cannula. Patient remained extubated
and on nasal cannula until 2025-07-29, when he started becoming
increasingly tachypneic and had an increased work of breathing.
He was transitioned to a non-rebreather, with O2 saturations
remaining in the low 1972, for which he was then reintubated. He
suspected to have a pneumonia and treated accordingly.
Ultimately he was extubated 2025-05-11. He was eventually weaned to
nasal cannula and transferred to the VICU. On 2025-07-29. The follow
day, he developed epistaxis in the setting of anticoagulation
and aspirated again. He was transferred to the ICU and
reintubated in that time. Given his multiple failed extubations,
ACS was consulted and he underwent tracheostomy and PEG
placement on 2025-05-31. This allowed him to be promptly weaned
from the vent to trach mask, which he continued on for the
duration of his stay. He has been doing very well with speaking
valve, ENT followed patient and will follow in clinic for
potential future use of vocal cords injection.
GI: Abdomen was left open following his operation due to ongoing
bleeding. He underwent multiple washouts and the abdomen was
unable to be easily closed due to loss of domain. ACS was
consulted for assistance with closure and Whitmann patch was
placed on 2025-04-14. Enteral feeds were initiated via OGT on 2025-02-04
which he tolerated without issue. Patient went back to the OR
multiple times with ACS for washout and tightening of the
Whitmann patch, and his abdomen was finally closed and RP
hematoma drained on 2025-08-08. On 2025-07-29 patient developed guaiac
+ stools and then frank melena with a Hct drop from 27 to 24.
Patient appropriately bumped to 27 after 1U RBC. GI consulted
for suspected upper GI bleed. On 2025-06-15 GI performed an EGD and
flex sig. The EGD showed ulcer ~1cm bellow UES without active
bleeding as well as a nodular fundus Risk of AKI ischemia vs polyps and
the flex sig showed normal colonic mucosa. On 2025-07-29 there was
concern for possible aspiration from TF, so TF were held and
continued to be through 2025-07-29. They were resumed, but were
again held due to high TF residuals. He ultimately tolerated
goal tube feeds via the NJ tube without issue. His NJ tube was
removed in the setting of his trach/peg on 2025-07-12.
Unfortunately, given his ongoing aspiration events, he could not
tolerated gastric feeds without significant concern for
aspiration. Awaiting operative decision making, the patient was
on TPN from 2025-02-16. In this setting, his NJT was
replaced on 2025-08-12. He tolerated goal tube feeds briefly and
then developed hematemesis, with concern from reulceration of
his known GEJ ulcer. On 2025-05-02 interventional radiology placed a
new GJ tube, and it was noted that the PEG placed by acs was
with ulceration was a source of bleeding. The patinet was unable
to remain on anticoagulation while this PEG is in place. Plans
were made for the patient to follow up with ACS for removal of
the PEG at a later date after the tract had matured. The GJ
placed by Brianna Warren was able to be used for tube feeds at the time of
discharge. PEG should remained capped, feedings should go though
J and G from GJ should remained capped.

GU: Patient had persistently increasing creatinine following his
operation and remained anuric. Renal was consulted and
recommended initiation of CRRT which was started on 2025-04-27.
Foley was removed and patient was bladder-scanned and straight
cathed as needed. He was transitioned to iHD which he required
until 2025-07-06, when his kidney function had returned and his
urine output was adequate. He needs to follow up with nephrology
in the next 2 months. At discharge his Creatinine was 1.0

Heme: Patient was started on a heparin gtt on 2025-06-15 after his
b/l BK pop cutdown and emobolectomies, for which he currently is
therapeutic on. His hemoglobin and hematocrit were trended and
he was transfused as needed. His heparin gtt was intermittently
held for bleeding issues including epistaxis and upper GI
bleeding from his fundal ulcer. Prior to discharge a IVC filter
was placed. He was discharged on aspirin and SQH as he required
multiple transfusion for GI bleed from PEG site when heparin
drip was initiated. Patient will remain on SQH until PEG tube is
removed by ACS. He will follow up with Dr. Brooks in clinic and
we will determine restart of anticoagulation.

ID: Perioperative antibiotics were administered. Patient became
febrile to 101.3 on 2025-07-29 and cultures were obtained and abx were
broadened from vanc/ancef to vanc/cefepime/flagyl. Patient was
seen to have an uptrending WBC and there a c/f HAP vs aspiration
pneumonitis for which patient received dose of micafungin on
2025-07-29. On 2025-07-29, WBC peaked at 33.5 and patient required

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Griffin,

You were admitted to the hospital because your aorta ruptured.
You underwent emergent surgery. During your stay you underwent a
number of surgeries and required complex medical care in the ICU
and floor units. Your aorta was repaired, both of your legs
required amputation, a tracheostomy tube was placed, two feeding
tubes were placed and a filter in a major vessel to your heart
had a filter placed to prevent blood clots. You tolerated these
procedure well and are now ready for discharge.

You should take your medications as prescribed and follow up
with all of your physicians, particularly your primary care
physician and vascular surgeon.

LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATION
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS
ACTIVITY
â¢You should keep your amputation site elevated and straight
whenever possible. This will prevent swelling of the stump and
maintain flexibility in your joint.
â¢It is very important that you put no weight or pressure on
your stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal
properly.
â¢You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if
applicable. It will take time to learn to use a walker and
learn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.

MEDICATION
â¢Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all
the medicine you should take at home. If a medication that you
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!

â¢You will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on
discharge which can be very constipating. If you take
narcotics, please also take a stool softener such as Colace.
If constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest
an additional over the counter laxative.

â¢You should take Tylenol 1982 every 6 hours, as needed for
pain. If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic
pain medication. You should require less pain medication each
day. Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.
Tylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter
and prescription medications. Be aware of how much Tylenol you
are taking in a day.

BATHING/SHOWERING:
â¢You may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or
pools until you have permission from your surgeon and the
incision is fully healed.
â¢After your shower, gently dry the incision well. Do not rub
the area.

WOUND CARE:
â¢Please keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that
there is no pressure on the stump. If there is no drainage,
you may leave the incision open to air.
â¢Your staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks. At
your followup appointment, we will see if the incision has
healed enough to remove the staples.
â¢Before you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to
replace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be
fully healed.

CALL THE OFFICE FOR: Fever
â¢Opening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your stump incision

â¢Redness, swelling or warmth in your stump.
â¢Fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening
incisional/stump pain

NO OTHER PROVIDER, EXCEPT YOUR VASCULAR SURGEON, SHOULD
DETERMINE IF YOUR STAPLES ARE READY TO BE REMOVED FROM YOUR
STUMP!
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE
VASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT +917937529624 TO DISCUSS. THE
STAPLES WILL BE REMOVED IN THE OFFICE AT YOUR FOLLOWUP
APPOINTMENT WHEN IT IS DETERMINED BY THE VASCULAR SURGEON THAT
THE WOUND HAS SUFFICIENTLY HEALED.

History of Present Illness:
2018 year-old lady with recent diagnosis of
DLBCL presenting for her first cycle of EPOCH.
Briefly, she presented in Dec 2021 with supraclavicular
lymphadenopathy and incidental finding of multiple abdominal
lymph nodes on AAA screening. Was seen by Dr. Jeffrey Simpson at
West Jackie and given high risk cytogenetics referred to West Jackie
for EPOCH with plan for prophylactic HD-MTX upon completion.
On arrival to the floor she feels well, only reports feeling
anxious as this is the first time she ever gets chemotherapy.

changes, dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness/numbnesss,
shortness
of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations,
abdominal
pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis,
hematochezia/melena, dysuria, hematuria, and new rashes.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (Per OMR, reviewed):
- Dec 2021: She found an asymptomatic lump along her left
collarbone over the summer. She went back and looked at pictures
of herself in the Dec 2021, and it was not there. It was not
painful, but persisted so she showed it to her PCP who got an U/S
which showed 4cm conglomeration of lymph nodes in the left
supraclavicular area. She also got an ultrasound of the abdomen
on the same day for AAA screening which showed enlarged lymph
nodes.
--She was referred to ENT (Dr. Jeffrey Simpson). FNA and laryngoscopy was
performed in the office, and excisional biopsy of a node was
planned. The FNA came back suspicious for malignancy so an
excisional lymph node biopsy was performed on 2025-03-14 and
confirmed lymphoma.
--2025-03-14: PET scan with massive abdominal adenopathy.
--2025-03-14: Initial oncology consult with Dr. Jeffrey Simpson. Dx with
DLBCL, stage III, IPI 2, Non-GCB with highly complex
cytogenetics.
--2025-03-14: Bone marrow Bx done with no evidence of disease

2001 F with a PMH of end-stage COPD on 2L home O2,
tobacco use, hypertension, A. fib, OSA on CPAP who presents with
1 week of worsening dyspnea, sputum production, and O2
requirements, consistent with a COPD exacerbation West Christina setting of
recent restart of smoking cigarettes.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
N/A Flare occurred Fergusonfort the setting of restarting smoking
cigarettes. Smoking cessation was encouraged while patient was
admitted (for herself and her family, who also smoke). Patient
was discharged with nicotine patch.
N/A Ambulatory O2 sat was 76% when not on oxygen. Patient was
discharged with home daytime oxygen (only used at night prior to
admission).
N/A Patient has outpatient appointment scheduled with PCP. Also
pending appointment with pulmonology, they will be contacting
patient within a few days of discharge to make appointment.
N/A Follow up pending Blood Cultures x2
N/A Continue to work on determining appropriate anticoagulation
for AF given CHADs2VASC of 2 with respect tos cerebral aneurysm.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
#COPD exacerbation
Patient presented with several days of worsening dyspnea,
increased sputum production, and increased O2 requirement of 4L
(from home baseline 2L at night). Trigger for this exacerbation
was likely that she recently restarted smoking about 2 weeks
prior to admission. Initial concern for pneumonia given CXR at
OSH was read as having infiltrate and patient was briefly
febrile West Christina ED here. She initially received Vanc, Cefepime and
azithro. CXR here was clear, patient had no further fevers, and
sputum culture only notable for respiratory flora. Vanc and
Cefepime were discontinued. Azithromycin was continued for 5
days for its anti-inflammatory properties (Improved symptoms). Patient
also received prednisone 40mg qd for a 5 day course (2025-07-18).
Patient received standing duonebs and albuterol prn while
hospitalized. She continued home Advair; home Spiriva was held
during admission given standing duonebs, but was restarted on
discharge. She received Benzonatate and
Guaifenesin-Dextromethorphan as needed for cough. Her SpO2
target was 88-92% given COPD. Ambulatory O2 saturation while on
RA was 76%, so patient was discharged with home daytime oxygen
(had previously been on oxygen only at night). She will follow
up with PCP and pulmonology. Smoking cessation was encouraged as
discussed below.

#AFib
Patient with history of Afib. She was observed on tele during
admission and was mostly AFib sinus rhythm with intermittent runs
of NSVTs. Per patient, prior hesitation around anticoagulation
given history of cerebral aneurysm. CHADS2-VASc score 2. Patient
received subQ heparin during admission. Per discussion with Dr.
Patricia Crawford, planned to hold SQH if platelets were <50 but this was
not necessary. She is to follow up with Dr. Patricia Crawford further
consideration of anticoagulation going forward.

#Dizziness, improving
#H/o BPPV
Patient complained of dizziness during admission, specifically
lightheadedness and feeling 'woozy'. She has a history of BPPV
but notes this sensation was different. Her typical BPPV
presents with a feeling of the room spinning, which did not
occur while hospitalized. Patient felt subjectively better after
receiving fluids. Likely etiology thought more likely to be
pre-syncope than vertigo. Her neuorologic exam was unchanged.
She received fluids as needed and was encouraged to increase her
PO intake.

#Thrombocytopenia
Per Dr. Patricia Crawford, felt to be from ITP. Her CBC was trended while
hospitalized and her platelets were uptrending. She will follow
up with outpatient hematology as previously planned. Platelet
level on day of discharge was 180.

#Smoking history
Patient reporting that she restarted smoking because ""everyone
North Joshuaton the house smokes"". Social work was consulted to help with
social supports and resources that would help her remain
abstinent from smoking. She was discharged with a script for
nicotine patch and was encouraged to not smoke. She was also
encouraged to avoid areas where others are smoking and to ask
her family to not smoke around her or her house.

#Chest pain, resolved
#GERD
Patient presented with chest pain on admission. She described
the pain as intermittent epigastric burning which began shortly
after eating breakfast, felt like her typical GERD symptoms.
There was no concern for ACS based on symptom pattern, negative
troponin, and normal EKG. She was continued on home omeprazole
and received Maalox prn for heartburn.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Cerebral aneurysm
She is followed by neurosurgery and will be managed as an
outpatient.

#Opioid dependence
She was continued home suboxone 8mg/2mg daily.

#OSA on bipap
She was continued on home bipap.

#Insomnia
She was continued on home alprazolam 0.25 mg qhs prn.

#CAD
#HTN
She was continued on home metoprolol.

Attending: Dr. Alice Lee.

Chief Complaint:
Obesity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Laparoscopic gastric band removal/laparoscopic gastric sleeve

History of Present Illness:
The patient is status post laparoscopic
adjustable band, had initial good weight loss then weight
regain and this was thought to be associated with hiatal
hernia. The patient ultimately developed significant severe
heartburn, and seeks to have lap band and port device removed.
The patient is still with significant weight related comorbid
conditions including back pain, knee pain, hyperlipidemia
sleep apnea and reflux. Heartburn was probably most likely
associated with lap band. The patient underwent preoperative
evaluation by multidisciplinary team who thought he should
benefit from removal of lap band and port and conversion to
sleeve gastrectomy and insurance approved.

Past Medical History:
PMH: asthma, COPD
PSH: s/p lap band in 2021, lap chole in 2017, right total knee
arthroplasty, c-sections in 1999, and 1972, tubal ligation
in 1992, ruptured tubal pregnancy in 1987

Pertinent Results:
Please see OMR for pertinent results.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to pre-op on 2025-03-13. Patient was
evaluated by anaesthesia.

The patient was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic
gastric band removal and sleeve gastrectomy for obesity. There
were no adverse events in the operating room; please see the
operative note for details. Pt was extubated, taken to the PACU
until stable, then transferred to the ward for observation.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a PCA. Pain was
very well controlled. The patient was then transitioned to
crushed oral pain medication once tolerating a stage 3 diet.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO. On postop day
1, the patient underwent an upper GI series exam, which did not
show any evidence of leak. Afterwards, the patient was started
on a stage 1 bariatric diet, which the patient tolerated well.
Subsequently, the patient was advanced to stage 2, and then
stage 3 diet which the patient was tolerating on day of
discharge.
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs
of infection, of which there were none.
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and Static dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
and hemodynamically stable. The patient was tolerating a
bariatric stage 3 diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance,
and pain was well controlled. The patient received discharge
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Altered mental status:
Patient had multifactorial reasons for altered mental status
including MVA, and on further questioning he also had a
different recent head trauma with a falling tree branch. Recent
head traumas raised questions of post-concussive syndrome. He
has also likely been underdialyzed recently due to problems with
peritoneal dialysis catheter, unclear what role this played in
altered mental status.

MRI imaging at OSH has been reported negative and exam is
without focal deficits. As for infection, blood cultures and
peritoneal fluid cultures sent from ED were negative. LP
negative.  Urinalysis and urine culture were negative. Patient
was treated with clindamycin for facial abrasion that he
suffered from a fall. Serum and urine tox screens negative
(aside from benzo +, which was expected medication). B12 and
folate levels were within normal range at presentation. TSH was
elevated slightly to 6.3 at presentation but free T4 wnl. This
slight TSH elevation unlikely to cause his presenting symptoms.
Neurology and psychiatry were consulted; an EEG was performed
and was unremarkable.  Patient had an MRI here that showed an
old R frontal stroke, raising the question of possible
underlying mild dementia from stroke.   His sister gave an
interesting history of declining cognitive function over the
past several months to year, with family members concerned about
his ability to manage finances.  Though he was able to have a
fairly normal conversation and was oriented x 3, detailed OT
testing showed some cognitive defects on examination such as
inability to balance checkbook).  He was monitored in-house
while other medical issues were being managed (see below for PD
catheter problems) Disposition was a question because in his
mental state he likely would not have been able to handle his
own peritoneal dialysis at home (lives alone).  Interestingly,
his mental status actually improved over the course of the next
week and he showed enough improvement on OT testing to go home
with support services.
.
#ESRD: Initially on PD, but soon catheter not functioning
appropriately, tunnelled line placed and started on HD.  Surgery
attempted to reposition the PD catheter but were unsuccessful
and it had to ultimately be removed. Patient had four sessions
of hemodialysis prior to discharge.  Pt to have outpatient
dialysis.
- follow up with Dr. Refrain from smoking or using tobacco products completely..
.
#. Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressures were initially not
well controlled, but his BP regimen was uptitrated and was
controlled in the SBP 130-140 range
- continue norvasc 10mg daily-
- Continue Metoprolol 150mg daily

#. Neurogenic bladder/bladder outlet obstruction:
Patient is at high risk for urinary tract infections given that
he has had a hx of needing to straight cath himself, though
urinalysis and urine culture have been negative. We inserted a
foley catheter initially, however once patient's confusion
resolved, his catheter was removed and he was able to urinate.
Pt later clarified that he has not had to straight-cath himself
for some time at home.

#. Hypothyroidism:
TSH elevated at OSH to 8.1 and only elevated to 6.3 here. His
free T4 was initially mildly decreased and then normal on repeat
testing.  Unlikely that his presentation of altered mental
status was due to hypothyroidism. We continued levothyroxine at
200 mcg daily.

Shortness of breath Complaint:
shortness of breath and cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Brown is a lovely 2025 y/o F with history of CKD, DM, Systolic (EF>55%), stroke, and gout who is presenting with worsening shortness of breath and cough for the last two weeks. About two weeks ago, the patient developed a runny nose, cough, and headache. The cough was productive of a green sputum. She went to her PCP and was given a Zpac on 2025-04-27. After the course of antibiotics she reports feeling a little bit better, but for the last two days her symptoms have been getting progressively worse. Now she has a productive yellow sputum and increasing cough. She is also c/o wheezing, worsening shortness of breath, low energy, and decreased appetite. +congestion The patient's exercise tolerance has been progressively worsening over the last year, and she can walk the length the driveway before getting tired. However, the patient's daughters now report that she cannot walk from the bedroom to the bathroom without getting fatigue. The patient is also reporting worsening PND, as she has been waking up almost one time every night gasping for air. She has a stable 2 pillow orthopnea that has not progressed recently. The patient denies any fevers/chills, headache, no chest pain, no pleuritic chest pain, no palpitations (only when nervous).
.
Of note, the patient's last CHF exacerbation was this past 1977, which her daughter's think was precipitated by a heavy salt diet. Since then the patient has been on a sodium restricted diet. The patient has exacerbations ~ every 07 months. Usually she will notice increasing Watsonshire edema and weight gain, both of which she denies with this episode. The patient does not think these current symptoms are c/w her usual CHF exacerbations and thinks that she just has a ""cold.""
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.1 98 155/85 18 93%
Labs and imaging significant for CXR that showed bilateral hilar and vascular engorgement, no mention of any pulmonary infiltrate.
Patient given 40 mg iv lasix, albuterol nebulizerm, and 750 mg IV levofloxacin x 1. Vitals on transfer were HR 80, RR 22, BP 125/72 98% 3L

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. Brown is a lovely 2025 y/o F with history of CKD, DM, dCHF (EF>55%), stroke, and gout who is presenting with worsening shortness of breath and cough for the last two weeks.
.
# shortness of breath: The patient's symptoms do not include Watsonshire edema or weight gain, which are her usual symptoms associated with her CHF exacerbations. Moreover, the patient's lung exam and productive cough are more consistent with a bronchitis or PNA picture. However, the patient did have crackles on her exam and her CXR showed evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. She also has an elevated white count. It is possible that an acute URI triggered a CHF exacerbation that is also contributing to her progressively worsening shortness of breath. The patient got IV Lasix 40 mg in ED as well as one dose of Levofloxacin. We monitored the patient's I/Os and checked her daily weights. We continued the patient on her home dose of Lasix (80 mg daily). Because the patient was given one dose of antibiotics in the ED, we decided to complete the course and give her 250 mg of Levofloxacin every 48 hours, for a total of 7 days. It is likely that the patient had a URI or PNA, and that this was not an acute exacerbation of her CHF.
.
# asthma: The patient was wheezing on exam; this could be a acute exacerbation of her asthma. That patient takes Flovent and Albuterol at home, which we continued. We also added Ipratropium nebulizers, and gave the patient a prescription at discharge, as well.
.
Inactive Issues:
# HTN: The patient's blood pressures were well controlled on her home medications: amlodipine 5 mg daily, and Atenolol 12.5 mg qhs.
.
# HLD: We continnued Pravastatin 40 mg daily
.
# CKD: Calcitriol 0.25 mg daily, Vitamin D, Aggrenox. The patient recently got her Epogen shot, so she was not due for one on this admission.
.
# GERD: We continued Pantoprazole 40 mg daily
.
# DM: The patient has diet controlled DM, but while in the hospital we ordered an isulin sliding scale and checked her FSG to ensure proper glycemic control.
.
Transitional Issues:
respiratory status: The patient was discharged on Atrovent inhaler as well as her Albuterol and Flovent. Patient should follow up with PCP to decide whether the extra inhaler is beneficial.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Brown,

It was such a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore. You were admitted for shortness of breath and coughing. Based on your symptoms we do not think that this was your heart failure, but we think that you had an infection of your lungs instead that caused you to have shortness of breath.

We are going to give you some antibiotics to treat your lung infection. We are also going to give you a prescription for another inhaler that will help with your breathing.

START Levofloxacin 250 mg every other day for five more doses
START Ipratropium inhaler, as needed whenever you get shortness of breath

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

Followup Instructions:
Schedule imaging after 1 month to evaluate treatment progress."

taken to the operating room on 2025-01-04 for closed reduction
and percutaneous pinning of the left hip. For full details of
the procedure please see the separately dictated operative
report. The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable
condition and after satisfactory recovery from anesthesia was
transferred to the floor. The patient was initially given IV
fluids and IV pain medications, and progressed to a regular diet
and oral medications by POD#1. The patient was given

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Bullock is a 2017 year old woman with developmental delay with
history of mechanical Aortic Valve Replacement and possible hx
of CABG in 2016, s/p dual chamber pacemaker placement, who
presented with chest pain on exertion x 10min. She was walking
near South Raymondton when chest pain started suddenly 01:07 PM, improved
to No relief after nitroglycerin when sat down, then resolved completely with further
rest. Chest pain lasted about 10 min in total, was associated
with shortness of breath, diaphoresis but no nausea. EMS found
patient hyperventilating with elevated SBP to 170, HR 54. She
received aspirin 81mg x2 and oxygen.

Patient no longer had chest pain on arrival to the ED and was
admitted overnight. She was found to have incomplete LBBB on
EKG, which appears to be old from prior EKG. There are no pacer
spikes on EKGs. Vital signs prior to transfer to floor were T
98.3, HR 86, BP 147/64, RR 18, O2 sat 96%. She is slightly
subtherapeutic on her warfarin for a mechanical valve.

Upon arrival to the floor the patient was comfortable and pain
free. Per discussion with the patient's sister, the patient had
a similar episode approximately 2 weeks ago and may have had a
negative stress test two weeks ago. Patient had no further
episodes of chest pain overnight and feels at her baseline. She
strongly prefered to return home as soon as possible. She was
supposed to participate in Special Olympics (events: walking and
shotput) this weekend but will no longer be able to participate.

admission, the heaviness began to intensify after lunch, around
2 pm. Patient lives at 789 Oak Ave, Los Angeles, CA and became
concerned with the persistence of her symptoms, so she contacted
the home nurses associated with Jodi Reese. Per her nurses, she
was denying pain at the time they evaluated her but she was
complaining of L arm tingling. Her vitals at the time: BP
160/100, HR 100s, satting 98% on RA. She appeared diaphoretic.
Her nurses contacted EMS, who checked an EKG which demonstated
ST elevations in leads III and AVF. She was transferred to Stanford Health Care
for further eval.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: Pulse 112, SBP 167, rr 26, 99%
ra. An EKG demonstrated ST elevations in leads II (1mm), III and
aVF (2+mm), with reciprocal ST depressions in I, aVL, and V2.
Cath lab was activated. Pt received plavix 600 mg po x1,
morphine 1 mg, asa 325 mg po x1, and was placed on 4000 units of
heparin, plus heparin gtt. During cath, pt was noted to have 90%
stenosis of proximal LAD to diagonal, LCX with 80-90 % proximal
disease.

systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 2020 year old woman with hypertension who presented
with an inferior STEMI.
.
# Coronary artery disease: Patient had several risk factors,
including HTN and hyperlipidemia but had no prior history of
myocardial infarction or anginal symptoms. Her EKG was
consistent with an inferior STEMI with 100% occluded RCA,
3-vessel disease found on catherization. She had a bare metal
stent placed in the RCA. She may require require further
intervention for disease noted in her left circumflex and LAD,
to be determined in several weeks time after outpatient follow
up. Her CK peaked at 1722 (MB 278) at 12 am on 2025-04-30. She had
one additional episode ofchest pain on 2025-05-27, with an EKG showed
TWI and <1 mm STE in V3-V6. No intervention was taken.
At time of discharge, she was on changed to simvastatin 80 mg
(from atorvastatin 80 mg), Plavix 75 mg, Aspirin 325 mg, and
12.5 mg of metoprolol twice daily. Of note, her baseline liver
function tests were mildly elevated, possibly in setting of
myocardial infarction. She was not able to tolerate addition of
an Losartan 50 mg daily or further up-titration of her beta-blocker due
to asymptomatic hypotension overnight while sleeping (systolic
in the 130 â 139 mmHg (Hypertension Stage 1)).
- Further titration of her beta-blocker, including transition to
a once-daily formulation, and addition of an Losartan 50 mg daily
be further managed on an outpatient basis in follow-up.
.
# Heart function: Patient has had no prior echo. She had no
difficulties with oxygenation or shortness of breath. Her JVP
was noted to be mildly elevated at 9 cm. Her left and right
heart catherizations revealed elevated pressures, suggestive of
left ventricular systolic dysfunction in setting of inferior
myocardial infarction versus diastolic dysfunction in setting of
longstanding hypertension. She may also have some right
ventricular involvement with RCA occlusion. She was mildly
diruesed until she appeared euvolemic. A transthoracic echo was
completed on 2025-06-12 which showed a cardiac output of 10 L/min, 1+
MR, 1+ TR, EF of 55%. She had no clinical signs of failure, a
normal TSH 3.7, stable (although trending downward HCT), and tiw
as felt that the high output was most likely inaccurate
calculation of CO on Echo.
.
# Rhythm: Patient remained in sinus rhythm while monitored on
telemetry without any arrythmias.
.
# Hypertension: Patient's home medications were held. She had
borderline low blood pressure, so further uptitration of her
metoprolol and additional of other agents was deferred until
outpatient follow up. She was instructed to NOT resume her home
blood pressure medications until follow up.
.
# Anemia: Patient's baseline hematocrit per her primary care
physician's office was 40.7 in 2025-02-02. During her stay, she had
a stable slow drift downward in her hematocrit from 38-40 down
to 30. She had no signs of bleeding and her stools were guaiac
negative. Further work-up and evaluation of her anemia should be
completed as appropriate on an outpatient basis.
.
# White count: Patient had a leukocytosis to 17,000, but no
clinical signs of infection. It was felt that this was likely
secondary to her myocardial infection, and trended downward
during her stay.
.
# Disposition: Patient stayed on the cardiology floor for an
additional day to monitor her hematocrit and blood pressure,
both of which were stable. She was discharged home after being
cleared by physical therapy, and will receive physical therapy
at home. Cardiac rehabilitation was recommended. A copy of her
discharge summary was faxed to her primary care physician's
office (Dr. Wesley Lee at Wilsonville, Fax # +91-300-8502104.
Office number is +918107102833). A follow-up appointment was in
place with Dr. Matthew Le approximately two weeks after
discharge, and she will see her primary care physician within 39899
week of discharge.
.
# Code: Patient was full code during her admission.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 2023 man w/ recent large ICH and DVT s/p IVC filter
not on anticoagulation, who presents from rehab with
hypotension, and found to have PEs on Chest CTA at OSH as well
as increased bleeding at the site of his ICH, in the setting of
INR 1.3. The pt was doing well at Mcknightland but was found to be
hypotensive today, so was transferred to University College Hospital London.
There, Chest CTA revealed small PEs in the RLL, and Head CT
revealed re-bleeding at the site of the previous ICH, so he was
transferred here for Neurosurgical evaluation.

In the ED: VS - Temp 98.1F, HR 108, BP 138/94, R 25, O2-sat 98%
2L NC. He was found to have a WBC 20 with 84% PMNs, INR 1.4,
lactate 1.5, and subtherapeutic Dilantin level of 2.6. UA was
negative, CXR was clear, and Blood Cx were sent x2. ECG revealed
ST-segment changes in V4-V5, and he ruled-out for an MI with 2
sets of negative CEs. Head CT revealed a large left
frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with moderate edema
and mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, with no
midline shift or evidence of herniation. Head MRI confirmed the
large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding vasogenic edema, with left-sided sulcal effacement
but no evidence for uncal herniation or transtentorial
herniation; it also revealed bifrontal subdural hematomas as
well as subdural hematomas along the interhemispheric cistern
and the falx; there was no evidence for infarction. He was seen
by Neurosurgery, who recommended repeat CT neck / brain and CTA
brain to assess the vasculature. He was continued on Dilantin,
started on steroids, and coumadin was continued to be held. He
is being admitted to the ICU for close neurological monitoring

Past Medical History:
- Pt had MVA 2025-06-25 after cough-related syncopal event.
Unconscious at the scene, admitted to Duke University Hospital. Head
CT and pan-CT were unremarkable, INR was 2.8 at the time. Within
36 hours, developed large intracerebral hematoma, MRA negative.
Coumadin was stopped. Transferred to NE Rehab, where he has been
since.

NCHCT (2025-07-23) - There is an acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage
within the left frontoparietal lobes centered deep in the medial
subcortical white matter, measuring 5 cm AP x 3.5 cm CC x 2.3 cm
TRV. There is a moderate amount of surrounding vasogenic edema.
No discrete underlying mass is identified. There is one area
where the hemorrhage appears more heterogeneous (2:24), and this
may be due to swirling of blood (perhaps acute on chronic
hemorrhage) or an underlying mass. There is no evidence of
intraventricular extension of hemorrhage. There is mild mass
effect on the left lateral ventricles. No shift of the normally
midline structures. The suprasellar and basal cisterns are
preserved. There is a small amount of mucosal thickening in the
left maxillary sinus and a mucus retention cyst in the right
axillary sinus. The mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized
and aerated. A spongy lucent lesion in the left parietal bone
likely represents arachnoid granulations. There is no soft
tissue abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with moderate edema and mild mass effect on the left
lateral ventricle. No midline shift or evidence of herniation.
The location of the hemorrhage is atypical for hypertension, and
the acuity of the bleed in unusual two weeks post-contusion
unless this represents hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct,
or rebleeding. An underlying mass, AV malformation, and amyloid
angiopathy are also considerations and could be evaluated for by
CTA or MRI.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: It would be helpful to compare
to prior studies. The hemorrhage on this study does not appear
acute, given the extensive surrounding edema, but there might be
rebleeding into an established hematoma. I agree that the
etiology is not apparent, and that further work up is needed to
distinguish among the diagonstic possibilities listed.

CXR (2025-07-23) - The lungs are clear, with no evidence of pneumonia.
No effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
normal.

Head MRI (2025-07-23) - (PFI) Large left frontoparietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema
previously seen on CT examination. There is left-sided sulcal
effacement but no evidence for uncal herniation or
transtentorial herniation. There are also bifrontal subdural
hematomas as well as subdural hematomas along the
interhemispheric cistern and the falx. There is no evidence for
infarction. CTA or MRA could be used to further evaluate
intracerebral vasculature.

MRA intra and extra cranial vessels
1. Unremarkable cranial and cervical MRA, with no flow-limiting
stenosis or
aneurysm larger than 3 mm in diameter.
2. No evidence of vascular abnormality in the region of the
large left
parieto-occipital evolving hematoma.
3. Note that the thin, though extensive, subdural hematoma,
containing
predominantly extracellular methemoglobin (""late subacute"")
largely layering
about the left cerebral convexity, was not ""new"" on the 2025-05-18
MR
examination; rather, it was present on the admission CT of the
day before.
These findings are all consistent with post-traumatic,
multicompartmental

Bilateral Port Ashleystad
Extensive bilateral DVT as described above. If there is clinical
concern, and alteration in management will occur a dedicated MRV
can be used to evaluate for more proximal thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Colon is a 2023 year old gentleman with recent large ICH and
DVT s/p IVC filter not on anticoagulation, who presented to an
OSH with hypotension where he was found to have multiple
subsegmental PEs as well as what was thought to be increased
bleeding at the site of his ICH, in the setting of INR 1.4.

1. Intracerebral hematoma/subdural hematoma: The patient was
admitted with a question of re-bleeding into his previous ICH,
noted on Head CT and MRI. Unclear underlying etiology given that
INR 1.3 on arrival. MRI also noted bilateral SDH. Neurosurgery
and neurology were both consulted during admission. Final read
per radiology was consistent with subacute injury from original
inciting event with no acute process. The patient was initially
continued on phenytoin, but was changed to keppra due to
transaminitis. He will need to have his keppra titrated to
therapeutic level as indicated in discharge instructions.

2. Pulmonary emboli: The patient was noted to have multiple RLL
subsegmental pulmonary emboli on CTA at OSH. He is status post
IVC filter placement and not anticoagulated with an INR of 1.4
on admission. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his
hospital course, and repeat lower extremity noninvasive studies
demonstrated bilateral Port Ashleystad DVTs. The patient is not a candidate
for anticoagulation secondary to ICH and SDFH. After discussing
with neurology, he was started on 325 mg ASA.

3. ECG changes: Pt presented with concerning ST-changes on ECG,
unknown baseline. Ruled-out for MI w/ 2 sets negative CEs while
in ED. As stated above, he was started on ASA therapy during
hospitalization.

4. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with afib on ECG on admission,
and was intermitently tachycardic during hospitalization. Rate
controlled at home on atenolol and verapamil, not
anticoagulated. We continued verapimil on short acting dose and
converted to metoprolol while admitted, which was slowly
titrated up for adequate rate control. He was continued on
digoxin and verapamil during his hospital course. The patient
was also noted on telemetry to have a 20 beat run of what
initially appeared to be asymptomatic VT, which was concerning
in the setting of his recent MVA attributed to cough syncope.
Cardiology was asked to interpret the telemetry strip, which was
determined to be Afib with aberration. No further diagnostic
work-up was performed, but the patient will likely need a TTE as
an outpatient if not already performed.

5. Transaminitis: Patient was found to have increasing
transaminitis during his hospital course that peaked at 221/166
ALT/AST. On day of discharge, his ALT/AST were 198/146 with alk
phos 609 and tbili of 2.6. He was switched from phenytoin to
keppra over some concern of drug induced transaminitis. On
further questioning, the patient also has a significant EtOH
history, stating that he drinks at least a 6 pack of beer a day.
A RUQ ultrasound was negative for liver lesions with borderline
splenomegaly and biliary sludging. A follow-up appointment was
scheduled for the patient in outpatient St. Mary's Hospital clinic
at 2025-07-02. On discharge, hepatitis serologies were pending.

6. Hypertension: Patient initially admitted on atenolol and
verapamil, which was converted to metoprolol and verapamil
during hospitalization.

7. Hyperlipidemia: Continued on home statin therapy during
hospitalization.

8. COPD: Continued on home therapy during hospitalization.

Mediastinal re-exploration and repair of bleeding side branch of
the left internal mammary artery. Minimal bleeding noted

History of Present Illness:
This is a 2015 year old male with a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and polio as a child (with
residual left facial paralysis who presents with dyspnea,
depressed ejection fraction, and an abnormal nuclear stress test
after suffering a cerebral vascular acident in 2025-03-22.

In 2025-08-12 he presented to Silver Oaks Nursing Home Family with garbled incoherent
speech along with trouble with word finding. He was found to a
non hemorrhagic cerebral vascular accident. His symptoms
resolved within 19 hours and he does not have any
residual deficits. He was also found to have a CPK > 5000. His
longstanding Simvastatin was discontinued. He was also told he
had had a myocardial infarction.

Follow up testing revealed an abnormal nuclear stress revealing
and ejection fraction of 39% and a partial, large, severe
perfusion defect involving the entire inferior wall and the mid
and basal walls. A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed
multi-vessel coronary artery disease and he therefore was
referred for surgical evaluation.

Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior,
inferolateral and anterolateral hypokinesis.. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 2002 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. An
epi-aortic scan was performed which showed the ascending aorta
free of atheromatous disease at the clamp and canullation site.

POST BYPASS
There is a small improvement in overall systolic function.
LVEF~40%. There may be improvement of the inferior wall. RV
systolic function remains normal. The study is otherwise
unchanged from the prebypass period.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with Tata Memorial Hospital regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
On 2025-02-01 Mr. Howard was admitted and underwent Coronary artery
bypass grafting x4, with left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, reversed saphenous vein
single graft from the aorta to the first diagonal coronary
artery, reversed saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to
the first obtuse marginal coronary artery, and reversed
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the posterior
descending coronary artery. Please see the operative note for
details. He was brought to the surgical instensive care unit in
critical but stable condition. However, in the immediate
post-operative period he developed acute respiratory
insufficiency, hypotension, and excessive bleeding from his
chest tubes. He returned to the operating room and underwent a
mediastinal exploration for bleeding. He tolerated this
procedure well. He extubated by the following day and was
weaned from pressors. By post-operative day two he was
transferred to the step-down floor. His chest tubes and wires
were removed per protocol. He was seen by physical therapy.
His insulin was titrated to maintain a glucose below 150.
Despite his rising CK on zocor pre-operatively, lipitor was
started to protect his grafts. An e-mail was sent to Dr. Tammy Erickson his CK be checked in the near future to assess his
tolerance of this drug. His blood pressure did not allow the
addition of an ACE-inhibitor, but one should be added as his
blood pressure allows in the future secondary to his decreased
ejection fraction and chronic systolic heart failure. By
post-operative day four he was ready for discharge to home.
Follow-up appointments were advised.

Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis, both right and left sides


History of Present Illness:
This is a 2016 year old woman with a history of recurrent,
metastatic NSCLC to brain who presents for further evaluation of
hemoptysis.

The patient was most recently seen in Riverbend Medical clinic on 2025-07-15
where she was screened for DF/HCC protocol 25867 (A Phase Phase III
trial of MM-121 in Combination with Erlotinib in Three Groups of
Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer), a trial of tarceva +
MM-121, which is an anti-ErbB3 human monoclonal antibody
secondary to progression of disease on Tarceva.

Of note, she is s/p hospitalization at Fortis Healthcare from
2025-04-17 for shortness of breath and wheezing after
placement of an endobronchial stent (placed 2025-02-06 for
significant narrowing of the distal bronchus intermedius).
During this admission, she underwent removal of the stent on
2025-04-21 (secondary to stent migration) as well as right and left
thoracentesis of exudative fluid. She also had an Enterococcus
(Amp-S) blood stream infection for which she completed a 14 day
course of IV antibiotics.

The patient was also seen in the ED on 2025-02-25 for evaluation of
dysuria for which she was given a course of empiric Bactrim.

In the ED, the patient's vital signs were: T 97.4, HR 105, BP
140/88, RR 16, O2 saturation 97% on RA. The patient states that
at approximately 7:30 09:54 PM Tuesday, after supper, she coughed 18
times and had a small amount of bright red blood followed by a
very small amount of clot. Because she had been told to go to
the ED if this happened, she promptly went to the ED. In the
ED, she coughed again, but had clear white sputum. In the ED, a
bedside ultrasound done in the ED showed a small to moderate
sized pericardial effusion without evidence of neck tamponade.
An outpatient ECHO done 2025-01-10 showed ""Moderate pericardial
effusion without signs of tamponade"".

The patient denies experiencing any fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, or rash. She has diarrhea
from Tarceva. She has been experiencing increasing dyspnea on
exertion for a few weeks. She does not use home oxygen. She
has a chronic dry cough. No chest pain. She sleeps on two
pillows at home (chronic). She can lay flat when she sleeps.

Imaging:
CXR 2025-03-14
1. Right upper lobe cavitary mass and right paramediastinal
radiation
changes.
2. Multiloculated large right and moderate left pleural
effusions.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis.

CXR 2025-03-14:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous study from 2025-02-02.
There is large pleural effusion on the right side and small
amount of aerated lung within the mid lung zone. A mass in the
right upper lobe is again seen. No pneumothorax is seen. The
effusion on the left side has decreased slightly. There are no
signs for overt pulmonary edema.

CXR 2025-03-14:
There is a virtually complete collapse of the right lung and a
large volume of persistent right pleural effusion as well as a
moderate but increasing left pleural effusion. The apex of the
left lung is clear, the base is partially atelectatic.
Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured in the right chest,
unchanged in the left. No pneumothorax.

CXR 2025-03-14:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next
preceding portable chest examination obtained eight hours
earlier during the same day. During the interval, a right-sided
thoracocentesis has been performed and the right hemithorax
becomes partially translucent again. One can now identify a
distorted pattern of the pulmonary vasculature in the right
hemithorax suggestive of a mass in the right upper lobe area and
elevation of the right-sided hemidiaphragm. Quite obvious there
is some degree of mediastinal shift towards the right side
suggestive of major atelectatic and obstructive component in the
process. A preceding torso CT dated 2025-01-30 revealed
chronic post-surgical changes with associated volume loss as
well as radiation fibrosis in the right upper lung. The present
findings on the portable chest examination match these findings
grossly.

ECHO: 2025-01-10
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is probably normal (LVEF>55%) although views are
suboptimal. The right ventricular cavity is unusually small with
normal free wall contractility. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. Views of the right atrium are suboptimal
but there is probably sustained right atrial collapse (see clip
9), consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2025-04-22,
the pericardial effusion may now be slightly larger although
views are suboptimal for comparison. The ventricular cavity
sizes remain small.

ECHO: 2025-01-10
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The greatest dimension is seen in the
subcostal view (1.7 cm). In other views, the effusion measures
1.0 cm. The effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is
echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is
seen. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate, circumferential,
echodense pericardial effusion with no clear evidence of
pericardial tamponade by echocardiography. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 2016 year old woman with a history of
recurrent, metastatic NSCLC to brain, currently on Tarceva, who
presents after experiencing small hemoptysis at home associated
with several weeks of ongoing dyspnea on exertion found to have
reaccumulation of pleural fluid, s/p L and R thoracentesis.

# Small hemoptysis: Hemoptysis possibly secondary to progressive
lung disease; moreover the patient also had recent endobronchial
stent placed. After arrival at the hospital, the patient had
only small episodes of hemoptysis. Hct and hemodynamics
remained stbale. She will follow up with her outpatient
oncologist.

# Dyspnea on Exertion: Likely secondary to slightly larger R
pleural effusion +/- pericardial effusion. She was seen by
pulmonology and underwent both R and L sided thoracentesis with
improvement in her dyspnea and oxygen requirement. The patient
also had an ECHO done which was which showed evidence of R
atrial collapse in the setting of pericardial effusion that was
slightly larger than prior study. This will have to be followed
as an outpatient (see below). Upon discharge, the patient was
breathing comfortably on room air, and ambulating without any
shortness of breath.

The patient has outpatient follow up with IP in Call the cardiologist immediately if chest pain or shortness of breath occurs..

# Pericardial effusion: The patient was found to have slightly
larger pericardial effusion compared to prior study, as well as
new evidence of slight R atrial collapse. Cardiology was
consulted and the patient was given 2L of IVF and was sent to
Katherinestad for possible pericardiocentesis. However, on repeat
ECHO, there was no evidence of cardiac tamponade and no
procedure was performed. The patient has outpatient follow up
with Cardiology for a repeat ECHO to follow any interval size
changes in pericardial effusion the week after discharge.

# Enterobacter UTI: The patient complained of dysuria, and U/A
was positive. She was started on Vancomycin given previous
vancomycin sensitive enterococcus UTI, and Ceftriaxone for
empiric gram negative coverage. The culture grew out pan
sensitive enterobacter and she ultimately completed a three day
course of ceftriaxone prior to discharge.

# NSCLC: The patient was most recently been on erlotinib. Per
her outpatient oncologists, she is being currently screened for
suitability for a clinical trial, and is awaiting ECHO prior to
trial enrollment. We held tarceva after 2025-04-10 pending
decision regarding the clinical trial. However, given her
pleural and pericardial effusions, it was decided that the
patient should not be enrolled in the clinical trial. Instead,
prior to discharge, she was given Taxol and Carboplatin. The

medications, and progressed to a regular diet and oral
medications by POD#1. The patient was given Jon Nguyen DDS antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine. The patient's home
medications were continued throughout this hospitalization. The
patient worked with Mary Johnson, MSW who determined that discharge to extended
care facility was appropriate. The Moderate hospital course
was complicated by the emergence of fevers without origin.
Patient's blood cultures and urine cultures chest x-ray was sent
for analysis. No positive findings were found. The fever
subsided without treatment. Otherwise the Moderate hospital
course was otherwise unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is

Chief Complaint:
monitoring post esophageal monitoring; ""how am I going to eat?""

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophageal dilation

History of Present Illness:
Angela Morrow with hx of atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban and
digoxin, colon ca in remission, achalasia presenting for
monitoring after EGD with esophageal manometry study.

Pt initially presented to Singapore General Hospital in early Apr 2024
with gas and dyspepsia, found to have marked esophageal dilation
on imaging with severe food impaction, concerning for stricture,
achalasia, or mass. An EGD at that time was suggestive of
achalasia. She was transferred on 2025-03-10 to Singapore General Hospital for
consideration of esophageal dilation. At that time, she had lost
5 kg lbs 09:40 AM - 01:12 PM low appetite, indigestion, bloating, and
postprandial
""gas."" Apparently pt's daughter also has achalasia. During that
hospitalization, pt was treated for E. coli UTI and underwent
esophageal dilation with placement of NJT.

GI (Dr. Barbara Morris received a call on 2025-03-10 from RN from pt's East Charlesfurt
reporting that pt had lost 2 lbs since discharge, despite TFs at
50 cc/hr continuously. She was subsequently scheduled for
esophageal manometry study (which necessitates removal of NJT),
then barium swallow, and subsequent replacement of NJT.
Admission
was arranged given pt's inability to pass any significant solids,
liquids, or pills; procedures were coordinated between general GI
and ERCP teams.

On 2025-03-10, pt was taken to the endoscopy suite for EGD and MAC
assisted esophageal manometry catheter placement. A 36 channel
high resolution manometry catheter with impedance sensors was
passed through the R nares and the LES into the stomach. She was
then taken to West Williamfurt for manometry study, where
catheter
was connected to Manoscan, and adjusted to 51 cm to visualize
upper and lower esophageal sphincters. 10 single wet swallows and
2 sets of rapid wet swallows with normal saline were obtained.
Manometry catheter was then removed. Follow up barium swallow was
scheduled for 2025-03-10, with plan for NJT replacement on 2025-03-10
to allow time for some barium to pass, to reduce aspiration risk
during endoscopy.

On arrival to the floor, pt feels well. She denies N/V, F/C,
abdominal pain, chest pain, SOB. She describes herself as
anxious, but generally very healthy.

STUDIES/IMAGING:
EGD (2025-07-30):
â¢Food residue in esophagus, suctioned.
â¢EGJ felt tight and with mild resistance to scope passage.
â¢Given tight GEJ and need for anticoagulation, it was decided to
proceed with dilation with a CRE balloon to 20 mm. Under
endoscopic guidance CRE dilation was done to 20 mm with improved
post dilation appearance at the EGJ. Under endoscopic guidance
CRE dilation was done to 20 mm with improved post dilation
appearance at the EGJ.

Timed barium (2025-07-30):
1. Timed barium swallow with esophageal retention of contrast
which is consistent with achalasia
2. Of note, there was a persistent filling defect at the fundus
of the stomach, therefore a gastric mass cannot be excluded.
3. Esophageal column measurements as detailed above.

EGD (2025-07-30):
â¢A dilated, tortuous esophagus was seen. Liquid and solid food
was found in the esophagus which was removed by suction. Slight
resistance was felt upon passage of the scope at the LES.
â¢The esophageal manometry catheter was successfully inserted via
the right nostril into the stomach under direct endoscopic
visualization. It was secured to the right nare.
â¢Normal mucosa in the stomach.
Normal mucosa in the duodenum. The NJ tube was found which its
distal extremity sitting in the duodenum. The bridle was removed
and the NJ tube pulled out (before the EMS catheter was placed).

Brief Hospital Course:
Angela Morrow with AFib on xarelto, HTN, COPD, h/o colon cancer, prior E.
Coli UTI p/w dyspepsia, anorexia, wt loss without stricture or
mass on EGD, most consistent with achalasia, s/p esophageal
manometry and esophageal dilation. Recent NJ feeding tube with
weight gain, but this was discontinued for manometry study.
Admitted for timed barium swallow to evaluate for corkscrew
esophagus (negative), underwent esoph dilation 2025-01-13. Now
tolerating a mechanical soft diet.

# Suspected achalasia/dysphagia:
# Malnutrition:
The patient was admitted after EGD for manometry study on 2025-03-10,
during which her NJ tube was removed. She subsequently underwent
a timed barium study on 2025-03-10, consistent with achalasia. She
underwent repeat EGD on 2025-03-10 with esophageal dilation to 20mm.
Diet was advanced, and she was tolerating a mechanical soft diet
at the time of discharge. As a result, NJ tube replacement was
deferred. Electrolytes were WNL at discharge, last requiring
repletion on 2025-03-02. She will f/u with GI on 2025-08-05 to discuss
results of manometry study (pending at discharge) and evaluate
need for repeat esophageal dilation.

# Atrial fibrillation:
CHADS2 is 1 based on age, no medications to support diagnosis of
hypertension. Home Xarelto was held for esophageal dilation,
resumed at discharge. Home verapamil (80mg TID) was initially
held while NPO, resumed prior to discharge with reasonable HR
control (atrial fibrillation in the high Very low: <40 bpm 100s,
normotensive). Uptitration of verapamil was deferred to PCP
given
occasional bradycardia. Home digoxin was continued.

# Thrombocytopenia:
Plt 165 on admission, downtrended to 131 on 2025-03-10 and 127 on 2025-03-10.
Unclear baseline, but documented plt of 11 with valuves
in the mid Low mmHg. INR WNL on 2025-03-10, making DIC unlikely.
No
heparin exposure prior to decline to suggest HIT. No evidence of
active bleeding. Will require repeat CBC in 9 days to ensure
not continuing to downtrend. Patient stated she will f/u with her
PCP (Dr. Barbara Morris at Mayo Medical Center within the week. She will also be
seen by GI on 2025-03-10, at which time CBC can be rechecked.

2025-07-09 11:42 PM # 14808 CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE:
Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40% stenosis.

2025-07-09 8:50 AM # 14808 CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT):
No prior chest radiographs available. Moderate bilateral
pleural effusions layer dependently, obscuring the borders of
the cardiac silhouette, responsible for relaxation atelectasis,
worse in the right lower lobe than the left. Upper mediastinal
contours are normal. Right hilus is depressed due to
atelectasis. Left hilar pulmonary artery is enlarged. Upper
lungs clear. No pneumothorax

Brief Hospital Course:
1999 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation on
apixaban, newly diagnosed severe MR and moderate AI, who
presented for an outpatient right heart catheterization and
coronary angiography.
She was diagnosed with obstructive coronary artery disease and
was admitted for cardiac surgery evaluation for CABG, AVR and
MVR. On 2025-05-14 she underwent CABG/AVR/MVrepair/pulmonary vein Lymph node ligation
ligation/drainage of R pleural effusion and
repair of lung injury. She arrived in the ICU and required
volume resuscitation, methylene blue and pressors for post op
hypotension. She also had some bradycardia immediately post
operatively and EP was consulted for a possible transvenous wire
placement. They felt that her rhythm was stable and did not need
intervention but she would need a pacer at a later time. She had
persistent air leaks from her pleural chest tubes and required
continuous suction. She transferred out of the ICU to the
stepdown on POD5. On POD 7 she was found to be hypoxic and
hypotensive and was transferred back to the ICU. She became more
hypotensive and hypoxic and required reintubation. Her blood
pressure continued to drop and she required multiple
vasopressors. Her lactate was rising and the decision was made
to take her for a CTA to rule out aortic dissection and ischemic
bowel. Acute care surgery was consulted to evaluate the scan.
Per Dr. Richard Alexander was no problem with her aorta but the
appearance of her small bowel and her rising lactate suggested
that she had ischemic bowel. The ACS team and Dr. Richard Alexander
extensive discussions with the patient's sisters, and the
decision was made to not proceed with surgery and the patient
was made DNR with no escalation of care. She was pronounced dead
2025-07-10.
