Pertinent Results:
___ CT A/P: Mildly displaced multilevel left-sided rib 
fractures. At the site of rib fractures there is a chest tube, 
which does not enter into the thoracic cavity. There is 
subcutaneous emphysema with a small amount of hematoma at this 
site.  Small left basilar and apical pneumothorax.  Bibasilar 
atelectasis. Pleural calcifications may reflect asbestos 
exposure, correlate clinically. 

___ CT C-Spine: No fracture of the cervical spine. Compression 
deformity at T2 age-indeterminate but may relate to degenerative 
changes. Degenerative changes at C3-4 and C4-5 cause mild degree 
of central canal 
narrowing may predispose to cord injury in the setting of 
trauma. If there is concern for cord injury, MRI would be 
recommended. Left apical pneumothorax, seen on concurrent CT 
Torso. Patient is intubated. Nasogastric tube in the esophagus. 

___ CT Head: . No acute intracranial findings. Parenchymal 
atrophy and small vessel disease. 

___ TLS-Spine MRI: No evidence of acute fractures. Compression 
fractures involving T2, T5 and L1 are likely chronic given 
absence of marrow edema.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes 
as described above with multiple 
areas of mild to moderate foraminal stenosis and mild cord 
indentation at 
T5-T6 without cord signal intensity abnormality. 
Well-circumscribed 2-cm upper back subcutaneous lesion, most 
consistent with an epidermal inclusion cyst or a sebaceous cyst. 
Minimal marrow edema L2 and L3 and L5-S1 facets and C1-2 lateral 
mass joints , pattern most compatible with degenertive changes 
without secondary features to indicate acute trauma. Multilevel 
degenerative changes as described above. 

___ CXR: Asymmetric lucency of the left lung suggests an 
anterior pneumothorax in this supine patient. Right lower lobe 
opacity likely reflects new right pleural effusion (moderate) 
and right lower lobe consolidation. New moderately severe 
pulmonary edema. 

___ CT Chest: Bilateral moderate-sized simple pleural effusions 
and associated compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes, new 
since the prior study. Multifocal ground-glass opacities in the 
right lung may represent 
infection or aspiration. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the 
left anterior chest wall, has increased since the prior study. 
Interval resolution of a left-sided pneumothorax. Multiple left 
recent rib fractures and non-acute right rib fractures. 

___ CXR:  The Dobbhoff catheter is in the left main bronchus 
and should be removed. Stable severe right lower lobe pneumonia, 
bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis.  

___ CXR: The Dobbhoff tube is coiled in the stomach. The tip 
projects over the middle parts of the stomach. Normal 
tracheostomy tube. No evidence of complications. Unchanged left 
subclavian vein catheter. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis. 
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. The study and the 
report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

___ CXR: Improved ventilation at both lung bases with small 
remnant areas of atelectasis. No newly-occurred focal 
parenchymal opacities. Mild 
cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. 

___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff 
tube has been advanced. The tip of the tube now projects over 
the middle parts of the stomach. No evidence of complications. 
Otherwise, the radiograph is 
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro:  The patient requires medication for agitation, and 
should continue oxycodone and Tylenol prn pain, as well as 
clonidine, seroquel QHS, q16:00 and prn.  Zyprexa Zydis was used 
prn as well.  For his history of EtOH dependence and previous 
episodes of complicated withdrawal he was maintained on CIWA 
protocol with thiamine, folate & multivitamin for 
neuroprotection. Benzodiazepines were stopped ___.  He has been 
in restraints intermittently for agitation and pulling at lines.

CV: The pt was initally in septic shock from his pneumonia and 
required pressors to mainatin hemodynamic stability.  These were 
discontinued on ___.  The pt has been maintained on metoprolol 
25 mg BID

Pulm: The pt was initially intubated in the Emergency Department 
for agitation, emesis and concern for aspiration.  He was found 
to have a leftsided pneumothorax and a chest tube was placed in 
the ED.  This was found to enter the subcutaneous space and was 
removed.  The pneumothorax did resolve on serial films.  The pt 
did develop a likely aspiration pneumonia and was treated 
empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn, and completed a 10-day 
course on ___.  The pt was unable to wean from the vent and was 
very agitated by the ETT tube, a bedside percutaneous 
tracheostomy was performed in the ICU ___ with a #8 Portex.  He

History of Present Illness:
Patient seen and examined, agree with house officer admission 
note by Dr. ___ ___ with additions below

___ year old Female with a history of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, 
diverticulosis, and hemorrhoids, who presents with diarrhea, 
abdominal pain and frank hematochezia. She has IBS flares with 
abdominal pain every 3 months but notes that this pain is much 
more severe. She states the pain is crampy, intermittent and 
primarily in both lower quadrants. She has Nausea without 
vomiting. Had copious BMs since the day prior to admission which 
were watery, but in the middle of the night on the day of 
admission she had three episodes of rectal bleeding in which 
toilet was filled with bright red blood. She has not had rectal 
bleeding on any of her prior IBS flares. She felt lightheaded 
but no syncope.

In the ED initial VS were 97.9, 88, 113/46, 16, 96%RA. On exam, 
abdomen diffusely tender without rebound or guarding. The pain 
was maximal in the suprapubic region. Rectal exam showed frank 
blood in the vault. No hemorrhoids visible or palpated. EKG 
showed NSR with normal axis & intervals and no ischemic changes. 
Labs notable for WBC 14 (83%PMN), nml HCT, UA with a few 
bacteria and mod leuk esterase. 

As patient was drinking oral contrast for the CT she developed 
sharp substernal CP. Repeat EKG was unchanged and the troponin 
was negative. Patient given ASA 325mg although she was bleeding. 
Pain resolved with 2.5mg IV morphine but later returned. Bedside 
ultrasound was neg for aortic aneurysm/dissection and 
pericardial tamponade. Pain resolved with 5mg morphine. 

CT abd/pelvis showed thickened and abnormal stomach, wall 
thickening in right colon with adjacent thickening of the 
lateral conal fascia, and diverticuli, though not in the region 
of the abnormality to suggest diverticulitis as a cause. In 
addition to ASA and morphine patient was also given zosyn for 
presumed colitis. GI and surgery evaluated the patient and 
recommended admission to medicine.  

On arrival to the floor the patient is more comfortable and 
states that her pain has decreased and is almost at her baseline 
(has ___ abdominal pain at baseline). No further GI bleeding 
since coming to the ED.

STUDIES: 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 3:39 ___ 
IMPRESSION: 
Minimal patchy opacity in the right lung base, which is 
nonspecific, and may reflect atelectasis.  Aspiration or early 
infection is not excluded. 
 
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 4:36 ___ 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Colitis of the left colon along a 14-cm segment.  This may 
reflect 
ischemic colitis, however, infectious or inflammatory etiologies 
are not 
excluded.
2.  Colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
3.  Calcified 1.4 cm right renal arterial aneurysm, unchanged.
4.  7-mm hyperdense cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney, 
which could be better evaluated with ultrasound on a 
non-emergent basis.
5.  Unchanged 5-mm nodule in the right middle lobe, for which no 
further 
followup is required.

Sigmoidoscopy ___:
Impression:
Superficial ulceration, erythema, friability and abnormal 
vascularity in the splenic flexure compatible with colitis 
likely from ischemia (biopsy)
Normal mucosa in the sigmoid colon (biopsy)
Internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to transverse colon

PATHOLOGY EXAMINATION: ""DIAGNOSIS: 
Colonic mucosa, biopsies, three: 
A. Transverse:
Mildly active inflammation with regenerative changes. No chronic 
colitis seen.
B. Splenic flexure:
- Fragments of colonic mucosa with recent hemorrhage, likely 
procedural.
- Strips of surface epithelium admixed with neutrophils (not 
present on level 2 and cannot be further evaluated).
C. Sigmoid: Within normal limits.
Note: The differential diagnosis includes infection, some drugs, 
ischemia, etc. Clinical correlation is needed.""
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Abdominal Pain b/l lower quadrants, Acute Blood Loss Anemia, 
Ischemic Colitis, Rectal Bleeding, gastroenteritis:
Pt was were admitted with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. CT 
scan revealed wall thickening in the right colon in a watershed 
area pointing to ischemic colitis, although infection and 
diverticulitis were also on the differential. Pt's hematocrit 
remained low but stable. Labs notable for WBC 14 (83%PMN), nml 
HCT, UA with a few bacteria and mod leuk esterase. She was 
treated with IV fluids, and her pain controlled with morphine. A 
sigmoidoscopy was performed that also revealed evidence of 
ischemic colitis. Pt's pain resolved over the course of her 
stay, and her nausea was treated with compazine 5 mg. By day of 
discharge she was having no more bloody BMs and was able to eat. 
She was encouraged to take good PO, and to hold her high blood 
pressure meds until she follows up with her outpatient doctor. 

2. Chest Pain:
In the ED as the patient was drinking IV contrast, she developed 
substernal chest pain. An EKG was w/o ischemic changes and 3 
troponins returned negative. Ultrasound in the ED was neg for 
aortic aneurysm/dissection or pericardial tamponade. Given her 
history of ___ esophagus, her chest pain may have been GI 
related, or in the setting of acute bleeding, she may have been 
in a demand ischemia setting. Her chest pain did no recur in the 
hospital; she can discuss the merits of  an outpatient echo with 
her cardiologist. She was discharged chest pain free and 
encouraged to followup with a GI doctor. 

3. GERD. 
Continued PPI and H2 blocker.

4. Benign Hypertension. 
Antihypertensives were held due to normotension likely in 
setting of bleeding

5. Hyperlipidemia. 
Continued crestor

6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea. 
Continued CPAP on auto settings as inpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Pelvic fracture. He was initially admitted to the trauma 
surgery service.  He was seen by orthopedic surgery and a pin 
was placed through the distal femur and the leg was placed in 
traction in anticipation of possible surgery.  3d reconstructive 
CT imaging of the pelvis was performed.  Ultimately, it was 
decided to treat this fracture non operatively given his 
baseline functional status and the severity of his fracture on 
imaging.  The pin was removed. Pain was controlled with IV 
morphine and PO oxycodone.

# Retroperitoneal Bleed.  On CT, retroperitoneal and pelvic 
bleeding was discovered. Interventional radiology was consulted 
and patient was monitored clinically.  He remained 
hemodynamically stable and his hematocrit remained stable and no 
intervention was necessary. His hematocrit remained stable for 
the remainder of his hospitalization.

# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia - On ___, patient developed a 
fever, hypoxia and an infiltrate was noted on CXR.  He was 
started on empiric therapy for hospital acquired pneumonia of 
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime IV.  A 7 day course was 
completed with an improvement in his breathing, and a reduction 
in his oxygen requirement.  On the floor he was given standing 
albuterol and Atrovent nebs, and was had regular chest ___ with 
respiratory therapy with a significant improvement in function.  


# Tachycardia - Patient had tachycardia, alternating between 
sinus tachycardia and multifocal atrial tachycardia in the range 
of 110-140 early in his SICU course.  Cardiology was consulted 
and recommended up titration of his metoprolol. His metoprolol 
was gradually up titrated to 200mg PO tid.  As his clinical 
picture improved, this dose was gradually reduced to 50mg PO 
bid, with rates in the ___ on discharge.

# Nutrition - Initial speech and swallow evaluation found that 
it was unsafe for him to take anything PO due to aspiration 
risk. A Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed for nutrition and given 
tube feeds.  He pulled the feeding tube once, and it needed to 
be replaced.  Repeat speech/swallow evaluation with video 
swallow found him to be safe to eat pureed solids with nectar 
thickened liquids.  Feeding tube was removed and he was started 
on the recommended diet on discharge.

#. Goals of care - The patient had severe dementia, and had no 
health care proxy on admission.  Guardianship was obtained 
emergently given the patient initially tenuous clinical status.  
___ (___ has agreed to be Mr. ___ guardian.  On 
discussion with Mr. ___ tube placement was declined 
and it was decided to change Mr. ___ code status to 
DNR/DNI.

shift. 

CXR: ___: 
1.Left chest tube has been placed since 8 hr prior. Left 
hemopneumothorax is decreased. 
2. Left hemidiaphragm is elevated, which could be due to left 
lung base

XR Shoulder ___:  
Unremarkable appearance of the right shoulder on these limited 
views. 

CXR: ___: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Left chest 
tube is in place. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall no

apical pneumothorax. Otherwise, little change in the appearance 
of the heart and lungs. 

CXR ___: 
1. Interval increase in size of a small left apical 
pneumothorax. 
2. Increased left basilar opacification, likely representing a 
layering 
pleural effusion. 

CXR ___:
Left chest tube is in place. Left pneumothorax appears to be 
similar to 
previous examination, small. Right lung is well-aerated. 
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable 

CXR ___: Left chest tube is in place. Small left apical 
pneumothorax is unchanged. Lung volumes are lower than on the 
previous study. Elevated right hemidiaphragm is re- 
demonstrated. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Left rib 
fractures are partially imaged 

CXR ___: Left chest tube is in unchanged position.  Small left 
pneumothorax is unchanged. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.

CXR PA/LAT ___:  Left small pneumothorax is unchanged.  There 
is left lung volume loss and
elevation of left hemidiaphragm, similar to prior. There is 
small left pleural effusion/ hemothorax, similar to prior. 
Multiple left posterior rib fractures are again noted. No 
notable interval change since ___. Stable small left 
hemopneumothorax and left lung volume loss.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to ___ Emergency Department on 
___ from an outside hospital. Mr. ___ was evaluated by 
the acure care surgery team. Initial imaging (CT Abdomen ___ 
identified multiple rib fractures and small to moderate left 
pneumothorax and a grade 2 splenic laceration. ( 1. No 
suspicious arterially-enhancing liver lesions are identified.  
2. Unchanged sequela of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, 
including splenomegaly, paraesophageal, and splenic varices.  3. 
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.)  A same day CXR ___ 
showed again, multiple left rib fractures and small to moderate 
left pneumothorax. and layering left hemothorax. CT head and 
C-spine were negative. 

Given concern for continued hemopneumothorax, a left sided chest 
tube was placed on ___ and 200cc drained immediately, with an 
additional 800cc afterwards. Platelets were transfused prior to 
chest tube placement. The patient was restarted on his home 
rifaximin and lactulose. Home spironolactone held for 
hyperkalemia. The Acute Pain Service (APS) was consulted for an 
epidural, however the patient was deemed to not be a good 
candidate given the thromboyctopenia. Serial hematocrits 
stabilized: 40->35->36.8->35.6->33.1->33.1. Adjuncts were added 
for pain control: APAP ATC (cleared with hematology service 
given the history of liver disease) and additional pain control 
was achieved with a dilaudid PCA and lidocaine patch. The diet 
was advanced to clears and then ADAT regular. The patient was 
placed in the trauma surgical intensive care unit and a tertiary 
trauma survery was remarkable for shoulder pain. Plain films of 
shoulder were negative. The next day the patient was 
transitioned to po oxycodone, the dPCA was discontinued. 
However, the pain was poorly controlled and other adjuncts were 
adjusted: gabapentin increased, clonidine started, dilaudid 
PRNs. The chest tubes were placed to water seal and home BP 
medications were restarted. On ___, additional pain control 
was required and oxycodone was increased per APS.  The ___ CXR 
looked worse and CT was put back to suction. The patient was 
stable and transfered to the surgical care floor. The ___ CXR 
showed a persistence of PTX and thus the chest tube was kept on 
suction. Patient was demonstrating good respiratory excursion 
and using IS well. Physical therapy was consulted and 
recommended discharge to home when medically ready. 

On ___, repeat CXR continued to show a PTX and CT was kept on 
suction. Over the course of the next few days CXR imaging 
continued to show a persistent left sided apical PTX with small 
left costophrenic angle blunting. However the patient continued 
to remain afebrile, with increasingly better pain control, and 
continued to not experience any respiratory distress. On ___ 
CT output decreased to approximately less than 200cc/day and the 
CT was placed on water seal. On ___ CXR showed an unchanged 
apical PTX and the CT was pulled with stable post-pull CXR. On 
___ CXR again showed a stable PTX and Mr. ___ was 
prepared for discharge to home with close follow up with CXR 
imaging arranged. 

The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots 
were used during this stay and was encouraged to get up and 
ambulate as early as possible. At the time of discharge, the 
patient was doing well, afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  
The patient was tolerating a diet, ambulating, voiding without 
assistance, and pain was well controlled.  The patient received 
discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding 
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,
You were brought to the ___ ED after sustaining a fall from a 
ladder. You were found to have rib fractures, a collapses lung 
and a laceration of your spleen. You have recovered and are now 
ready to be discharged from the hospital.

Please read the following instructions:
*AVOID contact sports and/or any activity that may cause injury 
to your abdominal area for the next ___ weeks.
 
*If you suddenly become dizzy, lightheaded, feeling as if you 
are going to pass out go to the nearest Emergency Room as this 
could be a sign that you are having internal bleeding from your 
liver or spleen injury.
 
*AVOID any blood thinners such as Motrin, Naprosyn, Indocin, 
Aspirin, Coumadin or Plavix for at least ___ days unless 
otherwise instructed by the MD/NP/PA.

* Your injury caused multiple rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

SIGNIFICANT IMAGING:
=================
___ Head CT without Contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of an acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Slightly prominent ventricles and sulci for the patient's 
age, likely
related with the HIV status and unchanged since the prior study

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: 
 
In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly

quadrant of the
abdomen.

___ Transthoracic Echo
CONCLUSIONS: The left atrial volume index is moderately 
increased. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are 
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. 
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] 
Quantitative (3D) LVEF = 37%. Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal; there is mild free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is 
seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen ___ 0.3 cm2, RV 35 cc/beat). There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass 
is seen on the pulmonic valve.

IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Moderate global left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral 
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
ACTIVE ISSUES:
=============

#Fever: Initial presentation with Tm 102.9F in the setting of an 
admission CD4 of 123 in a HIV+ patient with poor HAART 
compliance.  Given her history of multiple opportunistic 
infections in the past, her presentation was most likely of 
infectious etiology with a broad differential vs ___.  Her 
hospital course began with admission to general medicine on 
___, where she began to spike fevers ___, resistant to 
acetaminophen/ibuprofen.  She was also tachycardic to the 120s, 
with a RR of 36.  She was given doses of azithromycin, 
vancomycin, and zosyn prior to transfer to the MICU on ___ 
for further medical management. In the MICU, she received two 
doses of acyclovir for HSV prophylaxis. Infectious disease was 
consulted. She had one episode of hypotension to SBPs ___ which 
was responsive to fluid bolus. She was transferred back to the 
floor on ___ when stable. Blood cultures x2 showed no growth. 
Her UA had protein and blood, and her urine culture showed no 
growth. CXR was clear, she had a negative respiratory viral 
panel, legionella urinary antigen was negative, S. pneumo 
antigen was negative, and glactomannan negative. C. diff was 
negative, stool culture was ordered for various tests and was 
negative. Cryptococcus was negative in serum and CSF. HSV was 
negative in CSF. CSF culture negative. Head CT was negative for 
toxoplasma or CNS lymphoma. Serologies were negative for 
toxoplasma. Parasite smear was negative, anaplasma is pending 
and Lyme pending. Strongyloides negative. EBV serologies were 
detected <200 (reference under 200). The patient underwent TTE 
which was negative for vegetations or myocarditis. Diagnostic 
studies were significant for EBV detection. Given negative work 
up, infectious disease believed patient had ___, antibiotics 
were discontinued and patient was monitored and remained 
hemodynamically stable and afebrile. On discharge, patient feels 
well with no localizing symptoms and back to baseline.   

#HIV: ___ CD4 218 VL7900 ___ CD4 nadir 8, found to have 
a CD4 on admission of 123. Was continued on her home 
Darunavir-Cobixistat, Doltegravur, Lamivudine.

___: attributed to hypotension, on admission 1.2, peak 1.6, 
improved after fluids to 1.4. Consider rechecking Cr in 1 week.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
#CHFrEF: Held metop in the setting of sepsis initially, HR after 
stabilized are in 60-70s so held on discharge.
Home hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate were held given 
hypotension. After patient stabilized, pressures remained 
110-120s so they were held on discharge. 

#Depression: Continued home paroxetine

#Ppx: Continued home Bactrim, Azithromycin

#H/o CMV viremia: Continued home valganciclovir

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
- Follow up pending labs
- Consider rechecking Cr, discharge Cr 1.4
- Echo in the setting of ___ with EF 37% with moderate to 
severe MR, mild pulmonary HTN, compared to prior studies, MR has 
worsened
- ___ hydralazine, metoprolol and isosorbide mononitrate 
given blood pressures stable at 110-120s

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED?:
You were admitted to ___ with fevers and body aches. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?: 
- We thought you had an infection and did testing to identify a 
cause.
- You required a short stay in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) 
when you started to look very sick with high temperatures 
(___), high heart rate (>120), and high respiratory rate (>36)
- We monitored you closely and gave you antibiotics to cover for 
any infection. The infectious team was consulted. 
- All your blood tests and scans came back negative and 
reassuring except a virus called ___ virus was detected 
in your blood 
- Your primary care doctor ___ follow up with you. It is now 
safe for you to go home. 

WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL: 
- We believe your symptoms of fever, fatigue and not feeling 
well was because your body was mounting a response to the 
___ virus. This can happen on HIV medications when your 
immune system becomes stronger. It is called ""Immune 
Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome"". Your HIV medications are 
working and you should continue taking them as prescribed. 
- Please attend all of your doctor appointments that we have 
made, listed below
- If you develop fever, body aches, shortness of breath, nausea, 
vomiting please call your doctor.  

It was a pleasure caring for you. Please follow up with your 
primary care doctor below.

Chief Complaint:
right knee pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ right knee resection arthroplasty and placement of 
antibiotic spacer
___ PICC placement

 
History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Followup 15 or 20-minute visit with
___ today.  Bone scan results discussed with her from
___.  We see a lot of increased tracer around the total
knee prosthesis on both the femoral and the tibial component,
more on the tibia.  This is consistent with
infection/osteomyelitis since we are picking up tracer on all
three phases of the scan.  As I noted in my prior visits,
aspiration of the knee fluid has been benign in final culture
results and in the number of white blood cells but that 
certainly
cannot rule out osteomyelitis of the bone, which would be
subsynovial.  Given her persistent pain, the number of surgeries
she has been through, the progressive radiolucency seen on plain
film and now with the bone scan, we are going to move forward
with a two-stage resection arthroplasty.  We will remove her
entire prosthesis.  Because she is quite stiff and has had the
prior osteotomy of the tibial tubercle with translocation and 
has
retained hardware including some broken hardware quite possibly
at surgery, need to take down the osteotomy, remove the 
hardware,
remove all the implants, and freshen up the tibial osteotomy 
site
for a reimplantation at the time she has her total knee
replacement 8 weeks later after interim antibiotic spacer and IV
antibiotics.  Even if she comes back with negative culture on 
the
multiple tibia cultures, I probably would still want to treat 
her
long six weeks with antibiotics since there is a high suspicion
that there is infection even though it is to date eliminated,
determination/detection.  ___ understands it we cannot
guarantee that she will have a pain free knee.  It is quite
possible that she will always have trouble with this knee.  She
has arthrofibrosis now and that certainly may be a problem 
later.
Longevity of implants in the setting of prior osteomyelitis
presumptive is hard to establish.  She will not be able to
weightbear on this extremity for 8 weeks until it is
re-implanted.  She does understand and will try and maintain 
some
amount of range of motion through the knee, but I do not think
she would be a great benefit for her to have a hinged type 
insert
since.  We are able to maintain nearly as much motion with a
custom antibiotic spacer.

 
Past Medical History:
PMH: She has low-grade asthma,
non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and is hypothyroid.

Past Surgical History:  As mentioned above, six knee operations
on the right knee at ___.  
She
has had a left ankle fusion with iliac crest bone graft ___ years
ago.  She has also had a partial thyroidectomy and a partial
salivary gland excision and cholecystectomy.

 
Social History:
___
Family History:
Family History:  Positive for nonspecific cancer, diabetes, 
heart
disease including CAD and hypertension, and neuropathy.

 
Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:  On physical exam, she appears with a cane today
(she was using crutches at prior visit).  Her knee is mildly
swollen, but not significantly warm to the touch.  The incision
is well healed.  Her motion is from approximately -10 of
extension to 80 degrees of flexion.  She does have pain.  There
is some tenderness to palpation along the medial aspect of her
joint line.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old-woman with a history of 
relapsed/refractory AML, s/p multiple failed therapies including 
allogenic stem cell transplant in ___, most recently 
on cabozatinib as part of DF/HCC Protocol ___: Phase 1 trial 
of cabozantinib in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. She 
presented with leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, anorexia 
and weakness and was found to have toxicity from cabozatinib. 
Her hospital course was complicated by aspergillus pneumonia and 
colitis.

# AML/Leukocytosis
Upon admission, the patient was treated with hydroxyurea with 
good response, and it was discontinued on ___ when her WBC 
reached 6.1. However, her white count continued to decrease and 
remained below 1.0 until discharge. Upon admission, she had 
elevated LFTs with ALT 99, AST 92, LDH 863, and AlkPhos 171. 
They continued to trend up with a peak on ___ of ALT 85, AST 
153, and AlkPhos 145. Subsequently, her total bilirubin trended 
up to 3.8 on ___. The changes were thought to be due to 
carbozatinib toxicity, and she was removed from the study. Her 
LFTs subsequently normalized by discharge. She received a repeat 
bone marrow biopsy on ___, which the full report is pending at 
discharge.

# Febrile Neutropenia
She became febrile early in the morning on ___ while 
neutropenic. She was started on cefepime and vancomycin. Blood 
cultures eventually showed no growth. Patient was found to have 
colitis by abdominal CT on ___. Cdiff was negative. She was 
switched from cefepime to meropenem until discharge, at which 
time she was sent home with ciprofloxacin for bacterial 
prophylaxis and 5 days of metronidazole. She became afebrile on 
___ and remained afebrile until discharge.

# Hemoptysis / Aspergillus Pneumonia
The patient reported hemoptysis, and ENT was consulted on ___. 
They determined that the source of bleeding was most likely 
mucosal given thrombocytopenia as they noted clotted blood at 
the back of the right nostril, however, the scope was limited 
and they could not see superiorly with the equipment. A CT chest 
on ___, however, showed cavitations and nodules, which were 
concerning for aspergillosis. Given that she had a history of 
aspergillosis with hemoptysis, she was started on ambisome 
initially for treatment with elevated bilirubin. Once the 
bilirubin normalized, she was given voriconazole until 
discharge.

# Thrombocytopenia
She had thrombocytopenia, which was likely secondary to her AML. 
She was consistently transfusion dependent and required frequent 
platelet transfusions. She had some gingival bleeding that 
resolved by the time of discharge.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  
  
Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose 
of 0.142 
mg/kg/min.  
  
IMAGING METHOD:  
  
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
Tracer was 
injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting 
images.  
  
Following resting images and two minutes following intravenous 
dipyridamole, 
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi 
was administered 
intravenously. Stress images were obtained approximately 30 
minutes following 
tracer injection.  
  
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.  
  
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model.  
  
INTERPRETATION:  
  
The image quality is adequate with some motion artifact. 
  
Left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
  
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the 
left ventricular myocardium.  
  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  
  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 71% with an 
EDV of 71 ml 
post stress.  
  
Compared with an exercise MIBI performed on ___ there is 
no appreciable 
interval change.  
  
IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion study. 2. EF of 71% 
with an EDV of 71

1. no PE detected to the subsegmental levels. 
2. No dissection. 
3. Small scattered ground glass opacities throughout both lungs 
are a non- 
specific finding and may represent small areas of inflammatory 
changes. No 
focal consolidations are seen. 

 
Final Report 
INDICATION: Chest pain. 
  
COMPARISON: Radiographs available from ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the chest were obtained 
with the use 
of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were performed. 
Additional 
right and left oblique reconstructions were obtained for further 
evaluation of 
the pulmonary vasculature. 
  
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The great vessels including 
the thoracic 
aorta are normal in caliber and patent. There is no dissection 
seen. No 
pulmonary embolus is detected at the subsegmental levels. There 
is no 
pericardial or pleural effusion. Note, there is a 
mild-to-moderate degree of 
dependent atelectasis bilaterally. Scattered centimeter 
ground-glass 
opacities, predominantly within the right upper lobe (3:44), are 
is a 
nonspecific finding and may represent small foci of inflammatory 
changes. No 
focal consolidations are seen. There is no pleural effusion. 
  
There is mild calcification of the trachea. No axillary or 
mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy is seen. A small hiatal hernia is unchanged 
since the ___, CT exam. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no acute fracture or dislocation. 
No concerning 
blastic or lytic lesions are seen. Moderate degenerative changes 
are present 
throughout the thoracic spine. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus to the subsegmental levels. 
2. No evidence of aortic dissection. 
3. Scattered centimeter ground-glass opacities, predominantly 
within the 
right upper lobe, are nonspecific and most likely reflect small 
foci of 
inflammatory change or infection. No focal consolidations are 
seen. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

  
 
.
___ CXR 
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was 
obtained. Slight 
blunting of the left costophrenic angle may relate to overlying 
soft tissue.  
A very trace effusion or pleural thickening cannot be entirely 
excluded. No 
focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is 
tortuous. The 
cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. 
  
IMPRESSION: Subtle blunting of the left costophrenic angle may 
relate to 
overlying soft tissue, although minimal pleural thickening or a 
very trace 
effusion cannot be entirely excluded. No focal consolidation or 
pulmonary 
edema.

Imaging:
==================
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 5:11 AM 
FINDINGS:  
  
Unchanged cardiomegaly and pacemaker with electrodes in expected 
position.  
There is aorta is tortuous and calcified, as before.  The 
mediastinal and 
hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
Lungs are 
clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are 
no acute 
osseous abnormalities. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M w/ HFrEF (30%), CAD, HTN, Type B Aortic dissection, CVA 
___, pacemaker presented from home with 2 days of intermittent 
chest pain. He was found to have ___ which resolved with IVF. 
His chest pain was felt to be angina in nature and 
improved with SLN. He is not interested in cardiac 
catheterization, so stress test was not pursued.

#Chest pain: Patient presented with chest pain felt to likely be 
angina in nature. Troponins to 0.03, downtrending and negative 
CK-MB felt to be likely from poor renal clearance rather than 
NSTEMI. ECG difficult to interpret in the setting of pacemaker. 
Pain improved with nitroglycerin. Patient felt to have 
progressive stable angina. Discussions with the patient and HCP 
indicated that patient would not be interested in cardiac 
catheterization, so stress test was not performed. Patient was 
medically optimized with lisinopril, metoprolol, and 
atorvastatin increased to 40 mg for high intensity statin 
therapy. Aspirin was continued.

___: Patient presented with Cr 2.1. This was felt to be 
pre-renal in etiology ___ poor po intake at home. This resolved 
with IVF administration. Lisinopril held initially in the 
setting ___ and restarted when Cr decreased. 

#Hypotension: Patient haad hypotension to ___ after 
receiving sublingual nitro x1 as well as likely hypovolemia. 
This improved over 24 hours. Sublingual nitro should be used 
with caution and close BP monitoring in the future.

#Leukocytosis: Patient had a leukocytosis of 12.3 on admission 
of unclear etiology. Patient was afebrile and asymptomatic, with 
no dyspnea, cough, dysuria. CXR was clear and his ostomy site 
was clean. The leukocytosis resolved without specific 
intervention.

#Anemia: Noted to have drop in H/H on this admission from 2 
weeks prior. Iron studies without iron deficiency. Had mild 
folate deficiency and was started on folate supplements. 

#Failure to thrive: Patient has been readmitted to the hospital 
many times in the last months with clear evidence of failure to 
thrive at home, intermittently refusing care and not allowing 
help with cleaning, including his urine and feces. He has 
evidence of skin breakdown related to immobility. In prolonged 
discussion with patient's son and the patient on both this 
admission and his prior (ending ___, the patient continues to 
express that his primary goal is to be home. His son hopes to 
honor these wishes and feels that his dad has the capacity to 
make this decision. While he is oriented, his insight is quite 
poor and I do not think the patient has true capacity to make 
this decision but his son, as HCP, does as long as the 
situation at home is safe. His recurrent admissions and poor 
care raise concerns about this however he has not had a true 
trial of home services (24 hours care and home visits from PCP) 
to help mimick a rehab. The family has now arranged for these 
services including PCP who will see patient on ___ at home. 
Should he continue to refuse care at home in this setting with 
poor hygeine and self neglect, will need to consider 
guardianship to help better care for patient. 

------------------
CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
#HFrEF
#Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure ExacerbationEF of 30% 
in ___. Patient has chronic lymphedema in lower extremities. He 
had crackles on exam indicative of pulmonary edema following 
administration of IV fluids for pre-renal ___ with increase in 
pro-BNP to 4413 from 1312. Diuresed ___ with 40 mg IV Lasix 
with improvement. Given intravascular depletion on admission, 
home dose of Lasix was reduced to 20 mg po daily. Can consider 
additional 20 mg po as needed for weight gain. Lisinopril held 
initially in setting ___ and ___ restarted at home dose. 
Metoprolol continued at home dose fractionated and then 
consolidated.

#Vitamin B12 deficiency
Continued B12 1000mcg PO daily. 

#Dental Caries. 
Patient has poor dentition. Nystatin mouth wash was offered four 
times daily, however patient regularly refused.

#Essential Hypertension
Continued home metoprolol fractionated. Held lisinopril 2.5 mg 
due to ___. Resumed once Cr decreased.

#CAD
Continued home ASA
Continued metoprolol fractionated. Can resume metoprolol XL on 
discharge.

#Vitamin D Deficiency
Continued vit D 50K units weekly

#Depression
Continued home dose of Citalopram 10 mg PO QD.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===========================
CHANGED Lasix to 20 mg po daily
CHANGED atorvastatin to 40 mg qhs
CHANGED meclizine to 12.5 mg daily prn for dizziness
STARTED folate supplements

[ ] PCP follow up through home visits with Dr. ___
[ ] Use caution with sublingual nitro as patient became 
hypotensive to ___
[ ] Encourage po intake at home
[ ] Would get weights at patients regularly if possible to 
assess volume status. Titrate furosemide depending on volume 
status given poor PO intake.
[ ] Patient discharged with 24hr services as well as home visits 
with ___ medicine practice. Consider palliative care 
services at home given patient's repeated decline of nursing 
care and his goals of care. 
[ ] In terms of goals of care, patient and HCP expressed 
strongly that patient wants to be at home and not at a 
facility.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with PMH T1DM, alcohol/IVDU abuse (sober x 
15 months), and hepatitis C who presented from outside hospital 
in ___.  Four days prior to admission, Pt had 
malaise/myalgias/nausea/vomiting that he thought was a stomach 
bug.  As he wasn't able to eat, Pt stopped taking his insulin.  
Two days prior to admission he became increasingly fatigued and 
shaky, which led him to present to ___.  Pt was started on 
insulin gtt and then transferred to ___.  

=================
___ ICU COURSE
=================
Pt was maintained on an insulin drip until his anion gap closed 
and he was able to tolerate PO, at which point he was 
transitioned to injectable insulin.  Also given brisk IV 
hydration and repletion of his hypokalemia/hypophosphatemia.  

# T1DM with # DKA:  Likely precipitated by nonadherence to 
insulin egimen in setting of GI illness.  No obvious infectious 
source on CXR or UA.  Put on insulin gtt, fluid repleted with ___ NS with K.  Transitioned to subq insulin hen anion gap 
closed.  ___ was consulted, and titrated Pt's insulin 
throughout his course. 

# NAUSEA/VOMITING:  DDx viral gastroenteritis vs. manifestation 
of Pt's DKA.  Had a borderline prolonged QTc on admission (see 
below), so antiemetics used sparingly during his course.  N/V 
improved as glycemic control improved.

# PROLONGED QTc:  No medications or drugs on board that could 
obviously prolong QTc.  Repeat EKG demonstrated QTc of 432.  

# HEPATITIS C:  Has never received Tx for same. 

# Hx ALCOHOL ABUSE and # Hx IVDU:  Patient denied recent use, no 
suggestion of intoxication, no withdrawal symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ y/o man with diabetes, coronary disease, systolic 
heart failure and chronic kidney disease admitted with pneumonia 
and acute renal failure.

1) Community Acquired Pneumonia: For pneumonia he was started on 
levofloxacin, renally dosed, and had symptomatic improvment, 
improved oxygenation, and leukocytosis rapidly. He was also 
given guaifenesin with codeine to help with cough, and nebulizer 
treatments. diagnosis supported by symptoms, white count, and 
infiltrate.  His fever curve trended down slowly, with Tmax 
101.4 on ___, and 100.6 on ___.  He was discharged home on 
___ with instructions to complete a 7 day course of 
antibiotics, with levaquin 750mg po q48hrs, last dose on ___.  

Based on his CXR on ___, repeat CXR was recommended in 4 weeks 
to ensure resolution of his infiltrate. ( IMPRESSION :  Left 
lower lobe pneumonia and possible additional involvement of 
right lower lobe. Radiographic follow up in 4 weeks after
completion of antibiotics is recommended to ensure resolution).
  

2) Acute Renal Failure: This was thought due to dehydration from 
his acute illness. He was given cautious IV fluid and his 
lisinopril and hctz were held.  His creatinine improved to 1.3

IMAGING:

Pelvic US ___: 
1. Tubular structure in right adnexa with echogenic contents, 
consistent with  pyosalpinx.  Endometriosis and/or neoplasm 
would be other considerations, however the elevated white count 
suggest pyosalpinx would be more likely. Ascites and omental 
stranding are also presumed to be inflammatory in nature given 
patient's clinical presentation. 
2.  Left hydrosalpinx.  Normal appearance of left ovary.  
3.  Right ovary not well evaluated on this exam due to 
displacement by adnexal structures, making complete exclusion of 
right ovarian torsion, as queried, not possible on this exam. 
  
Liver US ___: 1.  Biliary sludge without evidence of acute 
cholecystitis. No cholelithiasis. 
2.  0.___ile duct, similar to MR dated ___ 
without evidence  of stone.  3.  Small volume of ascites. 

CTA Chest ___: Limited exam due to body habitus and bolus 
timing. No evidence of large  pulmonary embolism.  No acute 
findings. Bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right. 

Lower extremity venous ultrasound ___: No evidence of deep 
venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower extremity veins. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted from the ED to the GYN service with the 
diagnosis of hematosalpynx thought to be related to 
anticoagulation from being on Xarelto. 
Please see below for detailed hospital course by system/problem:

1) Neuro: Ms. ___ had significant abdominal pain associated 
with a right hematosalpynx. She received IV pain medication 
however continued to have persistnet pain. APS was consulted who 
recommended a morphine PCA. This was continued until her diet 
was advanced to a regular diet after which she was transitioned 
to oral oxycodone and acetaminophen which controlled her pain 
adequately.

2) Hematosalypnx: This was thought to be related to beign 
anticoagulated on Xaralto. Therefore, this medication was held 
and all anticoagulation was held. The patient received multiple 
doses of Vitamin K and 2units FFP to reverse her coagulopathy 
following which her INR significantly improved. Although there 
was some suspicion for hemoperitoneum, her abdominal exam 
remained stable throughout with no hemodynamic instability or 
acute abdomen. She received 2 units pRBC for downtrending anemia 
with an appropriate response. 
The patient underwent an ___ guided drainage of right 
hematosalypnx with minimal fluid aspirated. There was no 
purulence noted at the time of drain. 

3) ID: the patient was noted to have a significant leukocytosis 
on admission. Due to some initial concern for pyosalpynx, the 
patient was started on gentamicin and clindamycin. She was 
afebrile until the day of above noted ___ drained when post 
procedurally she was triggered for a heart rate in the 130s and 
a temp of 101.4. She subsequently defevervesced with no further 
fevers. This was thought to be related to a inflammatory 
response after ___ drainage. Her antibiotics were subsequently 
discontinued given no clinical evidence of pyosalpynx or 
infection. ___ cultures did not grow anything.

4) GI: Initially, the patient had nausea, intermittent emesis 
and limited bowel function. She was maintained on a clear liquid 
diet due to concern for possible ileus and received a bowel 
regimen which significantly improved her symptoms. She was 
advanced to a regular diet without difficulty. Nutrtition was 
consulted given need for daily vitamin K who recommended Ensure 
supplementation. 

5) Heme: Patient was initially on Xaralto due to a history of 
superficial thrombosis and fam hx of DVT. Hematology was 
consulted who agreed with holding Xaralto on admission. Once 
hematocrits were stable with no evidence of ongoing bleeding 
into hematosalypnx, the patient was started on prophylactic 
anticoagulation (___ transitioned to lovenox, discharged on 
prophylactic lovenox). During her hospital stay, she had ___ 
ultrasound that was negative for a DVT (this was done to a 
complaint of lower extremity swelling)

6)Pulm: the patient had intermittent oxygen requirements. This 
was thought to be related to a combination of sleep apnea and 
fluid overload. A CTA chest was negative for a PE. A CXR showed 
possible fluid overload. Given clinical evidence of fluid 
overload (crackes on lung exam, ___ swelling) the patient 
received several doses of IV lasix and used the incentive 
spirometer following which she was weaned to room air without 
difficulty. The patient had normal ambulatory O2 sats prior to 
discharge.  

Ms. ___ was discharged home in stable condition on hospital day 
#8- ambulating independently, tolerating a regular diet and pain 
adequately controlled on oral pain regimen.

CXR:  Findings are most compatible with volume overload. An 
underlying
focal infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded. Repeat radiography 
recommended
after appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection. 
The enlarged
cardiac silhouette is stable since the prior study, but is an 
interval change
since the study of ___. A superimposed pericardial 
effusion cannot be
excluded. Correlate clinically.

EMG b/l arms:
Abnormal study. There is also evidence for severe, bilateral 
median
neuropathies at the wrist. There is evidence for a moderate, 
right ulnar
neuropathy at the elbow. There is also evidence for a 
generalized moderate
sensory motor polyneuropathy. Although the clinical history is 
worrisome for a median neuropathy at the cubital fossa, this was 
not confirmed on this study. There is no evidence for an ulnar 
neuropathy at the elbow or for a radial neuropathy on the right 
side.

TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size 
is normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis 
(LVEF = XX %). The right ventricular cavity is dilated and the 
free wall is hypokinetic. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion (does not 
exclude pericarditis).

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the left ventricle now appears less dilated and systolic 
function is improved. The images from the study of ___ 
are not available for review due to technical difficulties.  

EKG: multiple EKGs showing, Atrial tachycardia with 3:1 or 2:1 
block. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Low limb lead voltage. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Shortness of breath: CXR c/w pulmonary edema.  Given recent 
dietary indiscretion, possibly went into flash pulmonary edema 
from tachycardia.  No viral syndrome to suggest pericarditis and 
no pericardial effusion on echo (and patient not hypotensive, 
but hypertensive), and urea not elevated to extent that would 
expect to see uremic pericarditis.  Renal followed and patient 
had dialysis with UF on hospital ___ 1 and dialysis on ___ 3.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of chest pain and 
shortness of breath.  While you were here you had dialysis which 
helped your shortness of breath.  You had studies of your heart 
which showed that you were not having a heart attack.  Your 
chest pain improved.  It was thought that your chest was caused 
by the use of cocaine.  You had 2 episodes of your heart going 
very fast which was likely due to the cocaine.  You should stop 
using cocaine in order to improve your health.  You can talk to 
your doctors about ___ to do this when  you decide that this is 
something you want to do.
.
While you were here you had nerve studies of your arms which 
show that you have carpal tunel syndrome.  We will refer you to 
a hand surgeon in case you want their opinion on getting this 
surgically fixed.  Sometimes this type of pain can resolve on 
its own with wrist splints.  You can speak with Dr. ___ 
this with your next visit with him.
.
While you were here your Gabapentin was increased to 200mg each 
night.  This might help with your arm pain.  You can also pick 
up wrist splints which should be waiting for you at the 
___ on the second floor of the ___ 
Building.
.
Dr. ___ that you can use Percocet 1 pill before and 
after each dialysis session for your pain.  You should not use 
this medication while driving or operating machinery.
.
You should start taking Cinacalcet per your new prescription.  
Talk to your kidney doctor if you have a problem filling it.
.
You should continue to take all other prescriptions as 
prescribed by your doctor.
.
Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.  Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet
Fluid Restriction: 1.5 Liters per ___

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ CAD s/p CABG, CHF w/ EF ___ & ICD, 
A-fib on coumadin, and extensive smoking history who presents 
with SOB.  Today he was at home in his USOH when he began 
feeling acutely dyspnic.  He called EMS, who reported that he 
was cool/pale/diaphoretic and tachypnic to the ___ and satting 
in the ___.  He did not improve with albuterol, so they placed 
him on CPAP, after which he improved.  

On arrival to the ED, he was tachypnic to the ___ and had a 
collapsable IVC on bedside US.  CXR looked more volume 
overloaded, so they did not give him IVF.  His respiratory 
status improved with duonebs, and he received solumedrol.  Also, 
he received a dose of vanc/cefepime for presumed HCAP given 
opacities on CXR and ronchorous lung exam - the patient has not 
been febrile and does not report cough.  He was also started on 
a nitro gtt for SBP in the 160s out of concern for flash 
pulmonary edema, as CXR also w/ evidence of pulm edema.  Notable 
labs include WBC 7 w/ 49% Lymphocytes, Cr 2.3 (baseline 
1.4-1.5), Lactate 5.7 -> 3.7, and BNP in the 990s (no baseline). 


On arrival to the MICU, VS were 98 71 148/51 17 97% on Venturi 
mask.  The pt was comfortable and reports his SOB has improved 
but not yet back to baseline.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
(+) Per HPI  
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or 
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or 
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. 
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. 
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, 
or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or 
urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin 
changes.  

Of note, pt had workup in ___ at ___ for 
dyspnea, notable for:

- PFTs ___

""The findings suggest the presence of combined borderline 
restrictive and very mild obstructive physiology. The latter is 
at the level of the small airways. The mild reduction in the 
maximum breathing capacity suggests the possibility of mild 
neuromuscular weakness.""
Methacholine challenge: No bronchoconstrictor response to 
methacholine challenge.

- CT Chest ___
""There is minimal to moderate pleural parenchymal fibrosis noted 
in both upper lobes greater on the left side. Multiple calcified 
granulomas are also noted ranging from 2 mm to 8 mm. There are 
no noncalcified pulmonary nodules. No evidence for infiltrates 
or effusions. No evidence for bronchiectasis. Evaluation for 
mediastinal and hilar adenopathy is limited due to lack of IV 
contrast. There are no lymph nodes noted in the axillary 
regions.""

EKGS:
___ Normal sinus rhythm with intra-atrial conduction 
abnormality. Non-specific intraventricular conduction 
abnormality. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the QRS 
duration has increased. Atrial fibrillation/flutter is no longer 
present. ST segment abnormalities are less marked. 
___ Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction delay. Left 
atrial abnormality. Delayed R wave transition. Compared to the 
previous tracing of ___ the ventricular rate is faster and 
the Q-T interval has normalized. 

IMAGING:

___ TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is moderate to severe regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/septal/anterior 
hypokinesis and distal LV/apical akinesis. No masses or thrombi 
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal 
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate 
(___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, LV 
systolic function has slightly improved (LVEF on prior really 
___.  

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  Markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette with findings 
suggestive of chronic fluid overload with no evidence of acute 
pulmonary edema. 

___ CT Chest without contrast
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Prior tuberculosis/granulomatous infection evident in lung 
apices. No 
reactivation.  
2.  Posterior basilar ground glass opacification in the 
bilateral lower lobes could be pulmonary hemorrhage, drug 
reaction, or the early manifestation of chronic eosinophilic 
pneumonia, nonspecific or desquamative interstitial pneumonia.  
Supplementary prone imaging could be performed to see if this is 
unusual atelectasis or gravity dependent edema.  No evidence of 
pulmonary fibrosis. 
3.  Moderately severe emphysema. Probable pulmonary 
hypertension. 
4.  Extensive coronary and peripheral atherosclerosis detailed 
above. 

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___: 
Severe cardiomegaly progressed between ___ and ___, 
subsequently unchanged.  A combination of vascular engorgement 
and worsening interstitial abnormality suggests all the findings 
could be explained by cardiac decompensation.  Because of 
asymmetry in lower lobe involvement there could be concurrent 
right lower lobe pneumonia, but that diagnosis need not be 
invoked to explain the current findings.  Pleural effusions are 
small, if any. Transvenous pacer lead tip projects over the apex 
of the right ventricle.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF ___, 
afib on coumadin and amiodarone, and s/p ICD placement (h/o 
inappropriate shocks for AF), who presented to the ED with acute 
onset SOB likely secondary to exacerbation of undiagnosed COPD 
prompting admission to ICU on ___ followed by transfer to 
Medicine floor on ___.

# Shortness of breath/hypoxemia
On arrival to the MICU, VS were 98 71 148/51 17 97% on Venturi 
mask. The patient was comfortable and reported his SOB had 
improved. Empiric antibiotics and nitro drip were discontinued 
given lack of evidence for PNA or fluid overload. Respiratory 
status continued to improve with steroids and nebs for presumed 
COPD exacerbation. TTE revealed no change in his severe heart 
failure with increased EF ___. CT chest revealed prior 
tuberculosis/granulomatous infection (no reactivation), 
moderately severe emphysema, and basilar ground glass opacities 
that could be pulmonary hemorrhage, drug reaction, or the early 
manifestation of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. Because of the 
possibility of amiodarone-related pulmonary toxicity, home 
amiodarone was held. His respiratory status continued to improve 
on steroids and duo nebs and on transfer to the floor he 
reported almost his baseline respiratory status on nasal 
cannula. On the floor, he was continued on prednisone, 
azithromycin, and nebs, with decreased SOB, no tachypnea, and 
improving O2 sat. By the day of discharge, O2 sat was stably 
>90% on room air at rest and while ambulating. Patient was 
discharged on albuterol PRN and with early pulmonary follow up 
for new possible diagnosis of COPD and the question of 
amiodarone induced lung toxicity.
   
# Acute-on-chronic kidney disease
Baseline Cr 1.4-1.5. On admission, Cr was 2.3. This was though 
likely prerenal in etiology, although no obvious history of poor 
PO intake or GI losses. In the unit patient received NS @ 100 
cc/hr. Urine lytes demonstrated a FENA <1% and his Cr returned 
to its baseline level of 1.5 on ___. Home lisinopril and 
lasix were restarted on ___ and ___, respectively. Cr 
remained baseline 1.5 on day of discharge.

# Possible amiodarone toxicity
SOB and hypoxemia with GGOs on CT Chest could be secondary to 
amiodarone toxicity. LFTs were mildly elevated on ___, and 
normalized by ___. TSH was elevated at 11.0, T4 was normal. 
Cardiology/EP was consulted and recommended continuing to hold 
amiodarone, though stated that SOB was probably not due to 
amiodarone toxicity. Patient was scheduled for outpatient 
pulmonary follow up to further assess possibility of underlying 
amiodarone toxicity, as amio toxicity would warrant longer 
course of steroids. 

# CHF (EF ___ s/p ICD)
No evidence of acute volume overload on this admission (JVP 
~8cm, no leg swelling, CXR with cardiomegaly and e/o chronic 
volume overload). Repeat TTE this admission showed no 
significant change, increased EF ___. He was continued on his 
home digoxin and started on metoprolol (instead of his home 
atenolol, which is renally cleared, in the setting of ___. 
Additionally, his home lisinopril and lasix were held in the 
setting of ___. When ___ resolved, home lisinopril, lasix, and 
atenolol were restarted.

# Afib on coumadin
Patient with longstanding history of AFib s/p failed ablation 
and s/p ICD on coumadin. Started on amiodarone in ___ due to 
increasing fatigue, possibly due to AV dyssynchrony. Amiodarone 
held during admission and on discharge as above. He was in NSR 
throughout admission. EP interrogated the ICD, which 
demonstrated no inciting event to explain the sudden onset 
dyspnea. Patient declined ablation for rhythm control. His 
coumadin was held in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR after 
receiving vanc and cefepime in the ED (INR 4.2), which decreased 
to 2.2 by discharge. Patient was restarted on coumadin 2.5 mg QD 
with instructions for early follow up of his INR with his outpt 
cardiologist's office. Patient was scheduled for appointments 
with general cardiology and EP after discharge.

# Downtrending Hct
Patient's baseline Hct appears to be ___. Hct was 36 on 
admission ___ and decreased to 29.3 on ___, normocytic. 
Unclear etiology; the decreased Hct did not appear to be 
dilutional and there was no evidence of active bleeding. Hct was 
stable at 29.9 for the remainder of the admission.

# CAD s/p CABG
Admission EKG had no signs of active ischemia, and troponins 
were negative x2. He was continued on home ASA 81 mg and statin 
during admission.  

# Diabetes Mellitus, type II
Patient is on metformin at home, with good control (HgbA1c 6.2% 
on ___. Unclear if nephropathy is a complication of DM. 
During admission, he was placed on an insulin sliding scale and 
home metformin was held. Metformin restarted on discharge. 
 
# Hypertension  
Patient's home lisinopril was initially held for ___, and 
restarted after ___ resolved on ___. Home atenolol was 
replaced by metoprolol in the setting ___ (atenolol is 
renally cleared), and restarted after ___ resolved on ___.

# Hyperlipidemia  
Patient received home statin during admission.  

# Possible Aspiration in ICU

swallow was consulted. They found no evidence of obvious 
aspiration, however the patient's O2 sat decreased from 91 to 
high ___ on RA while eating. Though the desats could have been 
due to silent aspirations, they were more likely due to the 
ongoing COPD flare, and video swallow was deferred. There was no 
other concern for aspiration for the duration of the admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted with shortness of breath, 
probably due to a flare of COPD (emphysema). You were initially 
in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and then you were transferred 
to a general medicine floor when your breathing improved. For 
your COPD flare, you were treated with prednisone (steroids), 
nebulizer treatments, azithromycin (antibiotic), and extra 
oxygen. Your breathing improved and by the time of discharge, 
you were breathing comfortably without extra oxygen, both at 
rest and when you were walking.

Because amiodarone may have contributed to your shortness of 
breath, it was stopped while you were in the hospital. You 
should NOT take amiodarone unless your cardiologist tells you to 
restart it. We also set up an appointment with you with a 
pulmonologist, who will assess if the amiodarone may have caused 
some lung damage. We gave you a copy of some test results from 
___ - please bring a copy of these to the 
appointment with the pulmonologist.

When you were admitted to the hospital, your INR was high, 
indicating that the coumadin had made your blood too thin. We 
stopped the coumadin until your INR was normal again. Your INR 
was 2.2 on ___. 

Because you are a reliable patient, you can restart your 
coumadin also known as warfarin at home. Take your coumadin 2.5 
mg per day at home, and call your anticoagulation service on 
___.

Please call your doctor or go to an Emergency Room if you 
develop worsening shortness of breath, fever/chills, worsening 
shortness of breath when walking, inability to lie flat, chest 
pain, dark stools, or blood in your stool. Also please weigh 
yourself every morning and call your primary care doctor if your 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F with DM, HTN, and HL presenting with chest 
pressure that has been on and off for the past 3 weeks, 
worsening with exertion yesterday. She had negative troponins. 
EKG showed increased LAD and questionable new LAFB. Stress MIBI 
was performed and showed no focal myocardial defects and an EF 
of 63%.

# Atypical Chest Pain, likely secondary to SVT- Patient has 
chest pressure and R arm pain, occasional nausea. Pain sometimes 
occurs with exertion, sometimes does not not. Given her risk 
factors (former smoker, hypertension, DMII, + family hx of early 
MI, central obesity) and history, there is concern for worsening 
angina. The patient is currently chest pressure free, troponins 
were negative, and EKG has some conduction disturbance, but no 
ST elevations > 1mm and is relatively unchanged from ___ EKG 
(although worsening LAD and questionable new LAFB). Patient is 
unfortunatley allergic to ASA (swelling of throat and dyspnea), 
so aspirin is deferred. Also allergic to IV dye. 
- Patient received a persantine stress MIBI as an inpatient for 
evaluation of angina with exertion
- Stress MIBI showed no focal myocardial perfusion defects and 
normal wall motion with an ejection fraction of 63%. The patient 
did have some atypical anginal symptoms with the injection of 
persantine 
- Patient recieved in patient echo prior to discharge due to new 
cardiac murmur. This showed no significant valvular abnormality, 
but did show mild LV outflow tract obstruction. She was 
hyperdynamic (EF 70%), which per attending cardiologist can 
exagerate this finding. Metoprolol was started for this reason 
as well, as rate control should reduce level of LVOT. 
- Throughout hospitalization continued outpatient meds for 
management of hypertension, with addition of lisinopril 5mg for 
improved blood pressure control in the setting of diabetes.
- Patient was also started on Metoprolol succinate 50mg for SVT 
and hypertension.
- TSH was WNL.
 
# PUMP: Pt w/ trace pedal edema which is baseline. Has 
increasing fatigue over the last three weeks.  
- Persantine stress suggested EF was 63%. 
 
# RHYTHM: Pt w/ what may be new anterior fascicular block on 
first EKG in ED, w/ existant RBBB. New EKG showed worsening LAD. 
 
 
# DMII: Slightly elevated ___ upon arrival (190s). Metformin was 
held during hospitalization and the patient was started on 
Insulin Sliding Scale. Her last HbA1C was 6.9 in ___. 
Patient was discharged on her home dose of Metformin.  
 
# HTN: Blood presures elevated during hospitalization (150s/80s 
- 170s/80s). Home blood pressure medications (clonidine and 
amlodipine) were continued. Lisinopril 5mg was added to the 
patient's hypertension regimen for improved control. Given 
benefit to patients with diabetes, ACE-I can be titrated up in 
the outpatient setting. Patient also started on Metoprolol 
Succinate 50mg daily.  

# Hypothyroidism: Stable. Patient was continued on 
levothyroximne. TSH WNL during this hospitalization.  
 
# Trigeminal Neuralgia: Stable during this hospitalization. 
Patient was continued on her home regimen.  

# Hyperlipidemia - Patient was continued on home Pravastatin 
20mg. 

# Elevated WBC count - Patient was admitted with a WBC count of 
13, down to 12 today. CXR and UA were not suggestive of 
infection. Patient has been afebrile during hospitalization, 
with no picture concerning for infection. 

Transitional Issues:
- Further consideration of potential causes of atypical chest 
pain.
- Optimize HTN medication regimen (titrate ACE-I and B-blocker).
- Control LVOT with metoprolol succinate, f/u with Cardiology

Studies:
========
CXR ___
 - Small pleural effusions, mild to moderate pulmonary edema, 
and cardiomegaly suggest CHF. 

RUQ U/S ___
 - The gallbladder contains sludge and stones bones and is 
nondistended.  A shadowing stone is seen lodged in the neck of 
the gallbladder and the wall of the gallbladder is edematous.  
Gallbladder edema may be seen with hepatitis or heart failure, 
however in the setting of cholelithiasis with gallstone at the 
neck of the gallbladder, cannot exclude acute cholecystitis in 
the appropriate clinical setting. 

___ EXAMINATION:  Ultrasound procedure
Successful ultrasound-guided placement of ___ pigtail 
catheter into the gallbladder. Samples was sent for microbiology 
and chemistry evaluation. 5 cc of bilious secretions were 
aspirated after 10 cc of saline was instilled into the 
gallbladder.  Aspirated material was extremely thick and 
difficult to aspirate due to inspissation.

___ TTE
Endotracheal intubation performed days prior to study, and 
patient was sedated on propofol and monitored by nursing 
throughout the study. 

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage 
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No mass or thrombus is 
seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage. The right 
atrial appendage ejection velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There are 
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and 
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There are filamentous strands on the aortic 
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral prosthesis 
appears well seated, with normal disc motion and transvalvular 
gradient. A very small paravalvular mitral prosthesis leak is 
probably present with mild (1+) mitral regurgitation. There is 
at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Well-seated mitral mechanical prosthesis with mobile 
discs, normal gradients and mild paravalvular mitral 
regurgitation. Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
Unchanged severe bilateral pulmonary edema with asymmetric 
distribution in the right upper lobe.  This could be edema alone 
if the patient has mitral 
regurgitation, alternatively edema and concurrent right upper 
lobe pneumonia. 

___ EP Report
 Successful implantation of a temporary screw-in ventricular 
pacemaker (RV apical lead connected
to an external generator).
 There were no complications.
 Device interrogation in the morning.
 Continue antibiotics as per primary condition.
 PA and LAT chest X ray in AM to check lead placement.
 Permanent PPM after resolution of the infectious process/after 
surgery.

CT AP ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Small-moderate amount of intra-abdominal blood with the 
highest density blood around the liver and a small hematoma 
situated between the gallbladder and duodenum.  Active contrast 
extravasation is noted into this hematoma from a possible 
subcapsular branch arising from the right hepatic artery where a 
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube courses adjacent to the 
branch. 
2.  Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube appropriately positioned 
within the 
fundus of the gallbladder. 

CT CHEST ___
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Small-moderate amount of intra-abdominal blood with the 
highest density blood around the liver and a small hematoma 
situated between the gallbladder and duodenum.  Active contrast 
extravasation is noted into this hematoma from a possible 
subcapsular branch arising from the right hepatic artery where a 
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube courses adjacent to the 
branch. 
2.  Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube appropriately positioned 
within the 
fundus of the gallbladder.

HEPATIC ARTERIOGRAM ___
IMPRESSION:   
1. Technically successful coil and Gel-Foam embolization of the 
segment 4B 
hepatic artery branch which fills a hepatic pseudoaneurysm. 
2. LIJ central line is kinked and should not be used. 
3. Appropriate position of percutaneous cholecystostomy tube. 

FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT ___ cm right inguinal pseudoaneurysm.

CT A/P ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Hazy peribronchial nodular opacities in the right lower lobe 
and nodular consolidation in the left lower lobe consistent with 
aspiration versus pneumonia. 
2. The previously seen hematoma along the posterior inferior 
left lobe and 
medial gallbladder fossa is increased in size, with increased 
low-density 
fluid and clot. There is increased hemoperitoneum of 
intermediate density, 
with density in some places decreased from prior.  Findings are 
compatible 
with recent bleeding however ongoing bleeding cannot be 
definitively assessed on this noncontrast study. 
3. Small pseudoaneurysm in the right femoral access site seen on 
ultrasound is not well evaluated on this noncontrast study.  No 
significant right groin hematoma. 
4. The gallbladder contains previously administered contrast and 
a stone 
without contrast egress into the bile ducts, consistent with 
gallstone 
obstruction at gallbladder neck.  Recommend flushing of the 
percutaneous 
cholecystostomy tube.

==============
___ year-old female with mechanical mitral valve, congestive 
heart failure (EF 46% in ___, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
diabetes presenting with dyspnea and abdominal pain, found to 
have cholecystitis and in an acute exacerbation of HFpEF. 

Acute issues: 
=============
#Acute cholecystitis: RUQ ultrasound revealed gallbladder edema 
and a stone in the neck of the gallbladder. ACS evaluated 
patient and recommended percutaneous chlecystotomy and to defer 
surgery for 6 weeks in setting of comorbidities, late 
presentation, and coumadin anticoagulation for a mechanical 
mitrial valve.  Patient was given unasyn which was later 
broadened to Zosyn due to fevers and worsening clinical status. 
She improved on Zosyn and was transitioned back to Unasyn. She 
was stable on Unasyn and transitioned to augmentin at time of 
discharge.  
[ ] She will need to f/u with ACS within 2 weeks of discharge to 
plan lap CCY.
 
#Heart Block: Patient was transferred to the CCU from the 
medical floor due to new heart block and prolonged QT. Her home 
nodal agents were stopped. Electrophysiology evaluated the 
patient and recommended pacemaker once she cleared her 
infection. In the interim, she underwent temporary pacemaker 
placement through a RIJ. In the setting of percutaneous drain in 
her gallbladder, she was unable to undergo permanent pacemaker 
placement until after drain can be removed (in several weeks). 
She underwent screw-in pacemaker on ___. The plan will be to 
keep the temporary pacemaker in place until her gall-bladder 
drain heals and she is able to undergo CCY. After she undergoes 
CCY, she will be able to have a permanent pacemaker placed.   
  
#Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Upon transfer to the CCU, the 
patient became hypoxemic. CXR showed acute pulmonary edema. 
Hypoxemia worsened despite Lasix and nitro so she was intubated 
on ___. CVVH was initiated to remove fluid in the setting of 
acute renal failure (detailed below). Her pulmonary edema 
improved with improving volume status and she was extubated 
___.     
 
#Hypotension / Septic Shock: On ___ after intubation, patient 
became hypotensive to the ___ systolic and required levophed. 
The following day she developed a fever to 100.5 on unasyn and 
increasing pressor requirement with the addition of vasopressin. 
Her antibiotics were broadened to zosyn. The patient was also 
given glucocorticoids in setting of possible adrenal 
insufficiency related to chronic prednisone use for PMR. 
Pressors were weaned off on ___.      
 
#Acute renal failure: Baseline at 1.0. On admission Cr 1.6. 
Clearly volume overloaded, likely cause ___ was cardiorenal. 
Patient's creatinine continued to increase to 2.0 and she became 
anuric despite aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt and 
metolazone. CVVH was started on ___. Several liters of fluid 
were removed and the patient began to produce urine. CVVH was 
discontinued on ___. Her UOP subsequently improved. Her Cr upon 
discharge was 1.1.  
 
#Acute decompensation of HFpEF: EF 46% in ___. Per patient, 
baseline weight is 210 at home. In system, weights have been 
between 202-210lbs this past year. 216lbs on admission. 
Clinically volume overloaded with pitting edema, elevated JVP, 
and basilar crackles. Confirmed taking torsemide daily. 
Confirmed not changing her diet. Likely cause of her 
exacerbation was cholecystitis. Aggressive diuresis was 
attempted but the patient became anuric as detailed above. She 
improved after volume removal with CVVH. Renal function 
subsequently improved and the patient became euvolemic. She was 
discharged on metoprolol XL 200mg and torsemide 20mg daily.  
 
#Atrial fibrillation: s/p DCCV ___. EKG on admission 
revealed A-fib with slow conduction. Metoprolol was held, 
however patient continued to have slow conduction. She was 
determined to have heart block requiring trans-venous pacing (as 
detailed above). Warfarin initially held in setting of hepatic 
artery hemorrhage (as described below). She was bridged with 
heparin. Warfarin restarted prior to discharge. Her warfarin 
dose on discharge was 3mg 2x/wk, 4mg 5x/wk and INR 1.3.  
 
#Hepatic Artery Hemorrhage: Patient was found to have a 
significant drop in H/H on ___ with abdominal tenderness. CT 
A/P showed hemorrhage from the hepatic artery. She received 
multiple units of PRBCs. She underwent ___ embolization on ___ 
of the bleeding site and her H/H initially stabilized. 
Unfortunately, she continued to bleed slowly from her hepatic 
artery and required daily transfusions for the following 3 days. 
On ___ she underwent repeat hepatic artery embolization and her 
hgb remained stable the remainder of her hospitalization. 
 
#Anemia/Hemolysis: On admission, H/H far below baseline of 
___. No clear evidence of bleed although on anticoagulation. 
Hemolysis work up revealed low haptoglobin, schistocytes on 
smear, and elevated LDH. Likely hemolysis from mechanical mitral 
valve iso acute illness. H/H initially stabilized and no 
evidence of bleeding during hospitalization. 
 
#Severe MR: s/p mechanical MVR in ___. On Coumadin as 
outpatient. Intially was held in anticipation of pacemaker 
placement and in setting of intra-abdominal hemorrhage (as 
above). Patient remained on heparin gtt for bridging. She was 
restarted on Coumadin prior to discharge from the hospital with 
heparin bridge.  

#HTN: Well controlled in hospital. Imdur and hydralazine held at 
discharge.
 
#Hyperlipidemia: Continued home atorvastatin
 
#Diabetes, type 2, insulin dependent: patient stated she is on 
20 detemir at home but OMR showed 26 units detemir. On 
glarginine and ISS while in hospital. Home metformin held on 
admission and restarted upon discharge.

#Asthma: Continued home regimen of albuterol, fluticasone, and 
loratidine

#GERD: Continued home regimen of omeprazole

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you at ___.

Why did you come to the hospital?
 - You were concerned about your shortness of breath and 
abdominal pain

What did you receive in the hospital?
 - On imaging, you were found to have an gallstone leading to a 
gallbladder infection. You were given antibiotics. You 
eventually had a procedure that placed a tube into your 
gallbladder to relieve the pressure and clear out the infection. 
The tube in your gallbladder caused some bleeding in your 
abdomen so a procedure was performed to stop the bleeding.  
 - While we were monitoring you, your heart rate also slowed 
down significantly, a condition called complete heart block. You 
were given a temporary pacemaker to keep your heart rate up 
during the procedure. After you have your gall bladder removed, 
you will have a permanent placemaker placed. 

What should you do once you leave the hospital?
 - You will need to follow up with the surgeons who will arrange 
for removal of your your gallbladder surgically.  
 - You will need to follow-up with the cardiologists after your 
gallbladder is removed for a permanent pacemaker

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Care Team

Dear Ms ___, 

You were admitted with back pain and chest pain. Imaging was 
negative for anything concerning, but we did note that you might 
have a pneumonia. This could explain your pain, which has now 
improved. We started you on an antibiotic (levofloxacin) for 5 
days. You should follow up with your outpatient cardiologist if 
you continue to have chest pain. 

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

and ___ for RCA occlusion ___. Pre and post cath he
received Antiplatelet therapy (Asa 81, brilinta, cangrelor gtt)
as well as intraprocedural heparin gtt.  Post Cath he developed
HAs and was noted on exam today around 2pm to have left sided
vision loss and neglect when he got up to use the commode.  Head
CT showed Right parieto-occipital IPH with IVH and antiplatelet
therapy was held.  He presents as a direct transfer to the Neuro
ICU.  Currently he denies CP, SOB.  He c/o ""migraine headache""
and light sensitivity. He feels that his vision is blurry at

According to Atrius records he was in his usual state of health
until ___ when he developed significant chest pain in the
morning while making coffee. Pain radiated to the left arm.  He
became dizzy and lost consciousness and fell to the floor.  EMS
was called and prehospital ECG showed inferior STEMI.  When he
presented to OSH heart rate was in the ___ and ECG showed
complete heart block.  He was hypotensive with a blood pressure
in the ___.  Reportedly he was mentating throughout most of
his time in the ER.  He received atropine 1 mg, Levophed and 
then
dopamine drips and was placed on transcutaneous pacing.  He
remained hypotensive and was taken emergently to cardiac
catheterization.  In the Cath Lab, he was found to have
thrombotic total occlusion of the ostial RCA and an occluded
distal RCA with thrombus, likely embolic.  DES was placed in the
RCA. His blood pressure in the CCU on both high-dose dopamine

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with history of embryonal cell carcinoma of the 
mediastinum as a child treated with surgery, XRT and 
chemotherapy, invasive breast cancer leading to bilateral 
mastectomy ___ and subsequent treatment with tamoxifen 
whopresented to ___ with a STEMI s/p DES to the RCA on 
___, subsequently developed a left visual field cut, CT showing 
IPH and transferred to ___. Patient monitored in the neuro ICU 
for edema. Here, MRI showed ischemic infarcts in the PCA 
territory and the caudate, with hemorrhagic conversion in the 
PCA territory. 
Exam was initially significant for left hemianopia, extinction 
to double simultaneous stimulation on the left, and overall 
fatigue and sensitivity to light.

Stroke etiology at this time is unclear. Patient has known risk 
factors including a large PFO and sleep apnea. Another 
possibility is periprocedural infarction from manipulation of 
the vasculature, particularly if the patient is found to have 
atherosclerosis.

#Ischemic to hemorrhagic conversion of PCA infarct, and R 
Caudate head infarct.

#ICU course
On admission to the neuro ICU, patient had MRI/MRA which showed 
PCA territory infarct as well as right head caudate infarct. MRA 
showed no vessel cutoffs. Bedside ultrasound of right IJ 
(incision at the site from OSH) showed large thrombus in right 
IJ. Cardiology was consulted regarding post-stent care, as well 
as medication recommendations. They recommended starting 
antiplatelet therapy as soon as possible, but were agreeable to 
holding for at least one week. In terms of what medication to 
start, they recommended a Plavix assay to confirm Plavix 
response, and if patient is a responder to begin with Plavix 
monotherapy, and monitor patient inpatient while the medication 
is started. They advised against continuing tamoxifen due to its 
coagulopathy side effect. In chart review, patient was found to 
have a large PFO. 

Patient experienced a flushing sensation ___ after 
administration of hydralazine, oxycodone, and Lidocaine. This 
was thought to be likely to Lidocaine, as he has an allergy to 
novacaine which also involved flushing. He experienced a similar 
flushing sensation ___ after metoprolol and acetaminophen. 
After the latter episode, the patient reported diffuse and 
moving paresthesias in his bilateral legs, back, arms, and face. 
These paresthesias did not follow a sensory distribution and 
were thought not to be a central process. On ___ platelet 
reactivity study was sent. Discussed incidentally found right IJ 
clot (seen on ultrasound ___, which could not be treated with 
anticoagulation in the ICU due to acute hemorrhage. Plan was 
made to plan for a follow up ultrasound in 3 months after 
discharge to ensure resolution. 

On the floor, Mr ___ improved quickly and had only a residual 
left homonymous hemianopsia at the time of discharge. 

Plavix was re-started on ___ and patient had repeat head CT on 
___ that was stable. If patient continue to do well, anticipate 
re-starting aspirin on ___.  Patient was otherwise started on 
atorvastatin 40mg daily. 

Stroke etiology has yet to be elucidated. Patient has known risk 
factors including a large PFO and tamoxifen is known to 
predispose patients to venous clot (though no venous clot 
identified apart from R IJ).  He also has sleep apnea as well as 
some calcification in the aortic arch seen on CTA.  Another 
possibility is ___ infarction from manipulation of 
the vasculature. Stroke risk factors evaluated TSH 0.88, A1c 5.4 
and LDL 97. He has a PFO on chart review and redemonstrated on 
our TTE. Lower extremity ultrasound was negative for venous 
clot. 

#Hypertension:
Patient has a history of hypertension. He had previously been on 
lisinopril but he developed cough.  Blood pressures were well 
controlled on metoprolol.

Patient had a few episodes of orthostatic hypotension that 
improved with increased PO intake. 

#ST-elevation MI (STEMI) on ___ cardiac cath at ___ RCA occlusion   
- TTE ___ here showed possible PFO, previous ECHOs have showed 
PFO
- Plavix resumed on ___. Plan to resume ASA on ___ if stable 
- F/U platelet aggregation assay ___ 
- Cardiology recommended restarting lisinopril 5mg daily when 
appropriate though this was held in the hospital due to episodic 
orthostatic hypotension. This should be resumed as he becomes 
less deconditioned at acute rehab. 

#Leukocytosis: now afebrile, downtrending
- continue to monitor

#Low back pain: On ___, patient developed severe low back pain. 
 Patient had CT L-spine which revealed degenerative changes but 
no acute abnormalities. Pain was controlled on tramadol and 
Tylenol.  Pain resolved prior to discharge but did occur 
intermittently throughout his stay. 

#OSA: Patient was found to have OSA.  He will need a sleep study 
as an outpatient

#Hx of breast cancer: 
Patient has been on tamoxifen since ___.  Because it has been 
associated with increased risk of venous thrombus and patient 
has a PFO, we spoke with his primary oncologist, Dr. ___, 
___ this risk.  She recommended not re-starting tamoxifen for 
now and follow up with her as an outpatient. 

#RIJ Thrombus:
Discussed incidentally found right IJ clot (seen on ultrasound 
___, which could not be treated with anticoagulation in the 
ICU due to acute hemorrhage. Plan was made to plan for a follow 
up ultrasound in 3 months after discharge to ensure resolution.

Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Mr. ___,

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of changes in your vision 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE WITH HEMORRHAGIC 
CONVERSION, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen 
and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is 
the part of your body that controls and directs all the other 
parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived 
of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  

 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- recent heart surgery
- patent foramen ovale 

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
- STOP tamoxifen
- continue PLAVIX
- do not resume aspirin until ___

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team

IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Status post interval placement of aortic, SMA, and renal 
artery stents.  
Peripheral wedge-shaped hypoenhancement of the left lower pole 
of the kidney 
is consistent with renal infarction due to exclusion of an 
accessory lower 
pole renal artery, possibly accounting for patient's symptoms.  
No other acute 
process in the abdomen or pelvis is identified. 
2. Bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities are worrisome for 
developing 
infectious or inflammatory process.  Extensive mediastinal and 
hilar 
lymphadenopathy is likely reactive. 
3. Underlying chronic interstitial lung disease. 
4. Pulmonary nodules measure up to 8 mm for which CT is 
recommended as below. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  For incidentally detected multiple solid 
pulmonary nodules 
measuring 6 to 8mm, a CT follow-up in 3 to 6 months is 
recommended in a 
low-risk patient, with an optional CT follow-up in 18 to 24 
months. In a 
high-risk patient, both a CT follow-up in 3 to 6 months and in 
18 to 24 months 
is recommended.

IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process or hemorrhage. 
2. Opacified bilateral mastoid air cells and middle ear 
cavities.  No evidence 
of bony erosion on this nondedicated study.  Findings could 
reflect sequelae 
of chronic otitis media with bilateral mastoid effusions.  
Correlate 
clinically with patient's symptoms, including symptoms of otitis 
media. 
3. Chronic findings include age-appropriate global parenchymal 
loss and

1. No acute process within the abdomen or pelvis.  Specifically, 
no 
intra-abdominal or intrapelvic fluid collection. 
2. Unchanged splenomegaly. 
3. Patent aorto bi-iliac stent graft, ___ stent, and bilateral 
renal artery 
stents without definite evidence of endoleak.

pelvis for 
description of findings below diaphragm. 

___ CT a/p
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
-New indeterminate peripherally enhancing lesions in the muscle 
of the pelvis; 
they could represent intramuscular abscesses or myonecrosis.  
Intramuscular 
hematoma cannot be excluded especially in the right internal 
obturator muscle. 
-No intra-abdominal acute process. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Non emergent pelvic MRI 

___ CT chest
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
-Interval decrease but persistence of parenchymal opacities that 
could 
represent aspiration with superimposed infection. 

___ MRI pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Multiloculated centrally nonenhancing lesion with surrounding 
enhancement 
expanding the right obturator internus muscle is likely a 
hematoma.  No 
drainable fluid collection is identified. 
2. Ill-defined area of non enhancement in the left gluteus 
maximus muscle may 
reflect myonecrosis.  This area is predominantly low signal on 
T2 suggesting 
that this is not fluid. 
3. Area of hyperenhancement with multiple internal foci of 
hypoenhancement in 
the right gluteus maximus muscle is nonspecific but may reflect 
developing 
myonecrosis. 
4. Bilateral gluteal and adductor muscle edema.

seen. Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

___ CTA torso
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. No evidence of mesenteric ischemia.  Patent vasculature.  Due 
to metallic 
artifact, patency of a superior mesenteric artery stent is not 
well assessed 
with this technique. 
2. Interval progression of extensive bilateral ground-glass 
opacities and 
consolidations a consist with multifocal infection, ARDS, or 
both.  Underlying 
interstitial disease may also be present and a differential 
would be acute on 
chronic interstitial disease.  Associated mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy has 
slightly increased.  Differential for this also includes 
lymphoproliferative 
disorders. 
3. Interval increase in small volume ascites and small bilateral 
pleural 
effusions. 
4. New hyperdense ingested foreign body posteriorly within the 
stomach 
resembles a tooth.

1.  Extensive consolidation and ground-glass opacities 
throughout the lungs, 
most pronounced in the bilateral lower lobes, not significantly 
changed 
compared to prior CT from ___.  Findings are 
compatible with 
ARDS and/or multifocal pneumonia.. 
2.  Extensive honeycombing of the lungs, in keeping with 
background 
interstitial lung disease. 
3.  Mediastinal, bilateral hilar and supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy is 
unchanged. 
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged on the right and 
slightly 
increased on the left. 
4.  For evaluation of the neck and abdomen please see the 
dedicated CTs which 
were obtained at the same time.

changed from ___.  Previously characterized myonecrosis of the 
gluteus maximus 
muscles bilaterally is better appreciated on prior MRI. 
4. Bilateral pars defects at L5-S1 with associated mild grade 1 
anterolisthesis. 

___ MR head
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. In the cortex of the right posterior frontal and parietal 
regions are 
signal abnormalities which are likely chronic infarcts seen on 
the previous CT 
of ___ 
2. Leukoaraiosis is demonstrated in theperiventricular white 
matter. 
3. Increased FLAIR signal along the sulci of both cerebral 
hemispheres is a 
nonspecific finding and could be related to supplemental oxygen 
therapy or 
less likely due to meningitis.  Correlation with CSF findings 
recommended. 
4. No evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, mass or mass 
effect. 

___ EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study due to: 
  
1) Frequent broad-based blunted generalized discharges with a 
triphasic 
appearance, which are often periodic and often have a rhythmic 
delta component 
(GPD+R), which can be seen in setting of etiology-nonspecific 
encephalopathies, but may be suggestive of diffuse cortical 
hyperexcitability 
with potential to evolve to seizures. 
  
2) Burst suppression pattern, slowing, and disorganization of 
the background, 
which is suggestive of a severe global encephalopathy that is 
nonspecific as 
etiology but causes can include medications/sedation, global 
hypoxic ischemic 
injuries. By the end of the recording, the background 
transitions to diffuse 
continuous slowing, which may be secondary to weaning of 
sedation but is 
suggestive of a severe encephalopathy. 
  
The pushbutton events show no changes in the EEG background or 
electrographic 
seizure correlate. No areas of focal slowing or electrographic 
seizures are 
seen. 

___ GJ
IMPRESSION:  
  
Successful placement of a ___ extension 
gastrojejunostomy tube 
with its tip in the proximal jejunum.  The catheter can be used 
immediately. 

___ CT chest
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Findings in keeping with diffuse alveolar damage with 
interval clearance 
of the exudative/edematous phase and is now transitioning into 
the fibrotic 
phase. 
2.  Ground-glass changes with an anterior posterior graded is 
nonspecific and 
may represent interstitial edema, or may represent active 
inflammatory changes 
(organizing phase which could progress to further fibrosis). 
3.  Multiple confluent fibrotic nodules are also noted, which 
could be 
followed to establish benignity.  No superimposed airspace 
consolidation to 
suggest pneumonia. 
4.  The trachea appears widened in the coronal diameter and 
tracheobronchomalacia should be excluded. 
5.  Relative hypodensity of the blood pool suggesting anemia. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of DM, HLD, HTN, 
AAA s/p EVAR ___, ___, who presented with PAU at the 
top of the prior stent graft at level of renals.  He went to the 
OR on ___ for a PMEG.  Postoperatively, he did fine and was 
transferred to the VICU.  He had an episode of presumed 
aspiration and subsequent respiratory failure.  He was 
transferred to the ___ where he was treated for ARDS.  He 
remained intubated and sedated.  He was on intermittent 
pressors.  He was treated with CVVH. He was also treated with 
broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. He went to the OR on 
___ for a trach and PEG.  

Neuro: Patient had difficulties with vent dysychrony and 
overbreathing on the ventilator, requiring multiple different 
sedation regimens, including midazolam, precedex, dilaudid, 
Haldol, propofol. He had no reliable neuro exam while on 
sedation. After he was stabilized on pressure support, he was 
weaned off of sedation and neuro exam improved to withdrawal to 
pain and some spontaneous movement of the face and left upper 
extremity. Psych was consulted for assistance in sedation 
management as patient had a significant history of anxiety. He 
also had several CT scans of the head due to poor mental status 
and ultimately an MRI, which showed an old infarct but nothing 
to explain his poor mental status. There was some questionable 
sign of meningitis on the MRI, which subsequently led to an LP 
being performed on ___, which was negative for bacterial 
and HSV infections. EEG showed moderate to severe encephalopathy 
and later on new generalized periodic discharged for which he 
was started on keppra on ___. Neurology service was 
consulted to help us manage these issues. 

During the week of ___, the patient's neuro exam was of 
spontaneous movement of all four extremities; he did not follow 
commands or track. Given agitation, he was started on Seroquel 
on ___. 

Cardiovascular: Patient had aflutter/afib requiring diltiazem 
drip and heparin drips. He was intermittently on prn metoprolol 
and was on pressors for most of his icu course, which was 
eventually weaned off. He underwent a TEE to rule out culture 
negative endocarditis, which was negative.

During the week of ___, the patient was transitioned from 
diltizem drip to po diltiazem. His po regimen was uptitrated due 
to continued Afib/flutter with rate in the 110's-130's. He had a 
brief 4 hour period where he converted to sinus rhythm on 
___, however, he went back into Afib/flutter with poor rate 
control. Hence, cardiology was reconsulted. During this week, a 
bridge from heparin gtt to Coumadin was started.  

Pulmonary: Patient experienced an aspiration event which led to 
development of ARDS and pneumonia. He subsequently reaspirated 
while in the ICU and intubated due to high tube feed residuals 
which worsened his ARDS. He received a trach/peg on ___ due 
to prolonged intubation. He required paralysis for a brief 
period due to respiratory acidosis and overbreathing on the 
ventilator while on pressure support. He was ultimately 
stabilized on pressure support. Pulmonary was consulted to help 
us with management of these issues, and predicted that he would 
have a prolonged period on the ventilator, likely several 
months. 

GI: After receiving his trach/peg, he was fed through TFs until 
he aspirated even with the Gtube to gravity on ___. TFs were 
then stopped and he was started on TPN. He was eventually 
restarted on ___ of TFs with no residuals, followed by 
an exchange to a GJ with ___ to allow for distal feeding on 
___. His tube feeds via the J-limb were increased to goal 
and were tolerated well without any aspiration events. 

Renal: Patient developed ATN and CRRT was initiated to help with 
fluid removal to optimize his pulmonary status. He was trialed 
off of CRRT twice, which was not well tolerated. He eventually 
started making more urine even while on CRRT. Renal was 
consulted to help with management.

A tunneled dialysis catheter was placed on ___ in planning 
for intermittent HD. 

ID: Patient was treated with two courses of antibiotics for 
aspiration pneumonia. He was on vanc/zosyn from ___ and 
linezolid/zosyn (___). He was briefly on micafungin, which 
was discontinued after cultures were negative and the BDglucan 
was felt to be a contaminate. Other than pneumonia, no other 
sources of infection were ultimately identified. ID consult was 
obtained to assist us with these issues.

During the week of ___, there were no infectious disease 
related issues. 

Week of ___:
- patient was found to have ___ fungemia--> lines were 
removed and micafungin was started and transitioned to 
fluconazole po once sensitivities resulted; ophthalmology was 
consulted with the following comments: ""His anterior chamber is 
quiet without evidence of anterior inflammation. Dilated exam at 
bedside limited in view of peripheral retina due to patient 
cooperation, but there is a clear view to the posterior pole. He 
does have an exudate in the macula of his right eye and a small 
spot of peripapillary hemorrhage in the left eye, which may be 
related to his HTN and T2DM.  To be safe, will follow up with 
dilated exam in 1 week; please page sooner if there is any 
change in external exam or if the patient complains of any 
visual symptoms.

- underwent TTE/cardioversion on ___ with successful 
cardioversion to sinus tachycardia

- patient tolerated increasing periods of time off of ventilator

Week of ___:
- started to follow commands, smiled when providers walked in 
and said ""hi""
- tolerated tube feeds via J tube
- stayed on trach mask with no vent requirements
- worked with speech therapy, who fitted speech valve --> not to 
be used for >10 minutes, needs to have constant healthcare 
provider supervision when speaking valve in place, MAY NOT take 
anything PO

History of Present Illness:
___ with PMHx as below presents with c/f rhabdomyolysis. She 
presented to her PCP complaining of ___ 
weakness for approximately 1 week, and on ROS noted mild 
hematuria. The patient reports that over the last 9 days, she 
has developed progressive b/l shoulder weakness and hip 
weakness. She reports that up until ___ she was continuing her 
typical three days per week working out, and had not done any 
more exercise than usual. She woke up on ___ with significant 
girdle weakness so much so that it has been difficult for her to 
walk. She has denied any pain and very little stiffness. 
Otherwise no fevers/chills, cp, diarrhea, melena, rectal 
bleeding. She is on a statin which was stopped two days prior to 
this admission due to the muscle weakness.  
 She saw her nephrologist on ___, who she follows for CKD ___ 
DM, and was told that her creatinine was up from 3.0 to 3.7. In 
the setting of this weakness, her nephrologist suggested that 
she see her PCP. She saw her PCP, ___, on ___. Her PCP 
felt that this presentation was consistent with PMR, so they 
sent a set of labs including an ESR which was elevated to 58, 
and a CRP which was normal. They recommended drinking lots of 
water, stopping crestor, and calling if she did not improve. She 
did not improve, so decision as made to present to the ED.

RELEVANT IMAGING:
==================
___ renal US: 

FINDINGS:   
The right kidney measures 9.7 cm.  The left kidney measures 
10.1cm. Kidneys appear echogenic consistent with chronic medical 
renal disease.  Bilateral renal cysts are better assessed on 
prior MRI.  The hypoechoic left renal lesion described on prior 
MRI as ""Concerning for papillary renal cell carcinoma"" is 
visualized measuring approximately 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  There is 
no hydronephrosis.  Bladder is decompressed. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
Echogenic kidney most consistent with chronic medical renal 
disease.  Simple cysts and left renal interpolar lesion 
measuring 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm

___ thigh MRI:
FINDINGS:   
Muscles: Mild fluid signal is seen throughout the musculature 
bilateral 
thighs, greatest involving the rectus femoris muscles, left 
greater than 
right, as well as the right vastus lateralis and bilateral 
hamstring muscles. These findings are consist with myopathy.   
Bone marrow: No abnormal marrow signal.  
Other: Bilateral hamstring origin complexes appear grossly 
intact.   
Visualized intrapelvic soft tissues appear grossly unremarkable. 

  
IMPRESSION:  
Mild muscle edema throughout bilateral thigh musculature greater

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o woman with stage IV CKD ___ T2DM, and likely renal cell 
carcinoma, presentedwith 9d of proximal muscle weakness, found 
to have acute on chronic kidney injury in the setting of 
rhabdomyolysis of unclear etiology. ___ and ___ resolved with 
IVF.

#Muscle weakness: CK elevated to ~10k with elevated ALT/AST (low 
Alk Phos), both downtrended and her weakness improved with only 
d/c-ing statin and IVF. ESR was also elevated to 58 on ___, 
downtrended to 32 on ___. CRP remained normal. Rheumatology 
was consulted and felt her presentation was most likely 
statin-related myopathy, however they could not exclude 
inflammatory myopathy without a muscle biopsy. Their suspicion 
for inflammatory myopathy was increased due to her periorbital 
edema (although pt states this is chronic), as well as her 
?renal cell carcinoma. Of note, pt reports being up to date with 
colonoscopy, mammogram, and pap smear, with no reported evidence 
of malignant or premalignant lesions. She was discharged with 
improved weakness, and plan for muscle outpatient biopsy. 

___ on CKD: CKD reportedly ___ T2DM, baseline Cr ~3. ___ could 
be from myoglobinuria. FeNa ~ 60%--likely intrinsic renal given 
hx of CKD and recent myoglobinuria which could lead to ATN. 
Pre-renal cause seems unlikely given pt does not appear 
hypovolemic and increased FeNA. Post-renal obstruction seems 
unlikely given pt reports good urine output w/ no changes from 
baseline, and US with no hydronephrosis. Cr down to 3 on 
discharge.

#HTN: given ___ and ___, held HCTZ and losartan. Continued 
verapamil. BP was well-controlled (SBP 110s) on verapamil only, 
so she was instructed to continue holding HCTZ and losartan 
pending PCP ___.

#H/o gout  
- continue allopurinol at lower dose (100 mg every third day) 
due to GFR now 9.  

#Anemia: chronic, thought to be due to thal minor.  

#DM: Home glipizide was held and pt was maintained on Humalog 
sliding scale.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
-Losartan and HCTZ stopped. Check BP and electrolytes and 
restart as needed.
-Check chemistry to ___ on renal function
-Rheumatology recommending muscle biopsy to r/o inflammatory 
myositis. This was scheduled with surgery. Please discuss this 
with patient.
-Pt has rheumatology follow-up scheduled
-Will still need ___ MRI for known L renal mass
-If renal function worsens, may need dose adjustment of 
allopurinol

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came to the hospital with weakness and injury to your 
kidneys. We did tests that showed the most likely cause of your 
weakness and kidney dysfunction was your muscle injury. By the 
time of discharge, your kidney function had returned to its 
baseline before coming to the hospital.

We think your muscle injury is most likely related to the 
rosuvastatin (Crestor) you were taking, however, in order to be 
sure that it wasn't a different cause, we recommend that you 
consider a muscle biopsy and discuss with rheumatology what 
further treatment might be needed.

It was a pleasure being involved in your care.

IMAGES/RESULTS:
=============================
MRI HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ___: 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Incomplete examination with only a few sequences obtained, 
with obtained 
sequences demonstrating severe motion degradation. 
2. Within these confines, there is no definite evidence of focal 
slowed 
diffusion to suggest large acute infarction. 
3. Repeat imaging could be attempted if/when the patient is 
better able to 
tolerate examination. 

CARDIAC CATH ___:
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a small 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems. There is a 
60% stenosis in the proximal, mid,
and distal segments. There is severe calcification in the mid 
segment extending to the distal third of the
LAD.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a small caliber vessel. There is
mild tortuosity beginning in the proximal segment. There is a 
90% stenosis in the proximal segment.
There is a 90% stenosis in the proximal, mid segment a nd distal 
segments (serial lesions) and the
remaining of the vessel has severe diffuse disease. The vessel 
is heavily calcified.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a very 
small caliber vessel. There is mild tortuosity beginning in the 
mid segment. There is a 99% stenosis in the mid segment.
The Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a very 
small caliber vessel.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a medium caliber vessel. There is a
70% stenosis in the proximal segment. There is an 80% stenosis 
in the distal segment.

TTE ___
CONCLUSION: The left atrial volume index is normal. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity 
size. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral 
walls (see schematic) and preserved/normal contractility of the 
remaining segments. Quantitative biplane left ventricular 
ejection fraction is 31 %. Due to severity of mitral 
regurgitation, intrinsic left ventricular systolic function 
likely be lower. Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 
L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. Tissue Doppler suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP greater than 18mmHg). Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic 
sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a 
normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There 
is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a small circumferential pericardial 
effusion. There are no 2D or Doppler echocardiographic evidence 
of tamponade. A left pleural effusion is present. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
mild regional systolic dysfunction most consistent with single 
vessel coronary artery disease (PDA distribution). Moderate 
mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle 
dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
Small circumferential pericardial effusion without 
echocardiographic evidence for tamponade physiology.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST ___
FINDINGS:  
  
There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  
The 
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. 
  
There is no evidence of fracture.  The visualized portion of the 
paranasal 
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  
The visualized 
portion of the orbits are unremarkable.  Multiple EEG leads 
appreciated. ICA calc.   
IMPRESSION:   
1. No evidence of infarct, hemorrhage, edema.

CAROTID SERIES ___
IMPRESSION:  
Bilateral ___ ICA stenosis 
Antegrade vertebral flow 

EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because of mild background slowing that is nonspecific as 
to etiology, but Common causes are medication effect, 
infections, or toxic/metabolic disturbances. 
There was also focal intermittent slowing in the left temporal 
region, 
indicative of subcortical dysfunction in that region. Compared 
to the prior day's recording, focal intermittent slowing in the 
left temporal region is better appreciated. 

CT HEAD ___
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of mass, hemorrhage or infarction. 
Atrophy with white matter changes suggesting chronic small 
vessel schemia. 
  

EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because  of a slow background activity, consistent with a 
mild to moderate 
encephalopathy that is nonspecific as to etiology. Common causes 
are 
medication effect, infections, or toxic/metabolic disturbances. 
There was no  focal slowing, or epileptiform discharges. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
=====================
___ with no known PMH, minimal medical care admitted for NSTEMI 
and echo with wall motion abnormalities. Cath ___ with 
multi-vessel disease for which he will have CABG down the road. 
Hospital course complicated by multifactorial encephalopathy 
(toxic-metabolic, UTI, ?underlying dementia). Guardianship 
pursued during this hospitalization due to confusion. 

#CORONARIES: 3v CAD, 60% ___, mid, distal LMCA, 90% ___, mid, 
distal LAD (serial lesions),diffuse LAD disease (heavily 
calcified), 70% ___ RCA, 80% distal RCA, 99% mid LCX
#PUMP: near akinesis of inferior and inferolateral walls, EF 31%
#RHYTHM: pAF, mostly NSR, intermittently bradycardic

ACUTE ISSUES
=================
#NSTEMI
#Multivessel CAD
#HFrEF (31%)
Heart failure diagnosis is new this admission, ischemic etiology 
in setting of multivessel CAD. Will be worked up as an 
outpatient for possible CABG. TTE showed near akinesis of the 
inferior and inferolateral walls, EF 31%. Cath ___: 3v CAD, 70% 
___ RCA, 80% distal RCA, 99% mid LCX up to 90% diffuse LAD 
disease. Attempted to optimize medical therapy while waiting for 
guardianship for discharge to rehab while awaing CABG. 
Unfortunately had to discontinue ___ (and cannot give ___ in 
setting of worsening kidney function. Carvedilol could not be 
uptitrated in the setting of bradycardia. Did not start 
spironolactone in setting of borderline elevated potassium. 
Uptitrated imdur as tolerated, with plan to possibly add on 
hydral for better blood pressure control. This was not started 
during the hospitalization because blood pressures were 
acceptable (130s systolic) and simplification of medications was 
emphasized. Patient also intermittently refused medications in 
the setting of delirium as below.

#pAF
Seen overnight on tele, reverted to sinus by AM of ___, and 
remained in sinus. Started on apixaban renal dosing. 

#HTN
Hypertensive to 150s-160s in setting of intermittently refusing 
medications. Tolerated uptitration of imdur as above. Could not 
start spironolactone, ___ as above in setting of kidney 
function. Considered adding hydralazine, but opted for 
toleration of higher blood pressures and simplicity of 
medication administration given patient refusal of medications. 

#UTI
#Leukocytosis
No growth on urine cultures, although urine with bacteria. S/p 7 
day course of ceftriaxone during this hospitalization. 

#Altered mental status
Negative seizure and stroke workup, felt Likely multifactorial: 
toxic/metabolic iso UTI, delirium, and unknown dementia 
baseline. Waxing and waning hypoactive to hyperactive delirium, 
and he was intermittently refusing meds. Telemetry was 
discontinued and lab draws were minimized to minimize delirium. 
Since workup of treatable causes of delirium were negative, it 
is thought that his confusion is delirium in the setting of 
hospitalization, worsened by language barrier, with a component 
of toxic metabolic due to UTI as above. Initially he did not 
have an official healthcare proxy, so guardianship was pursued 
because he would be unable to consent for necessary rehab. 
However he stablizied medically, and was able to name ___ 
healthcare proxy on ___. He was therefore discharged home with 
services, and was intermittently confused on discharge. 

___
Creatinine 1.6 on admission, baseline unclear. Initially trended 
down, nadir 1.2, max 1.7 this admission. Likely pre-renal iso 
poor PO intake and reduced EF. 

#Goals of care
Unclear if CABG is within his goals of care, and with 
intermittent confusion, difficult to elicit wishes. Healthcare 
proxy named this hospitalization. Guardianship hearing ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
 - You were admitted because you had a heart attack  

 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- Your heart arteries were examined (cardiac catheterization) 
which showed narrowing of multiple arteries. No stents were 
placed, because it would be better for you to have surgery on 
your heart arteries. 
- You had some confusion concerning for neurologic changes. Head 
imaging (CAT SCAN and MRI) did not show acute stroke or bleed, 
and blood tests didn't show any clear cause for your confusion. 
People often become confused in the hospital when they are in 
unfamiliar surroundings (delirium). 
 
 WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
 ================================  
- Please take all your prescribed medications as scheduled.
- Please attend any follow-up appointments you have. You have a 
list of appointments below. 
- Please weigh yourself every day. Your weight on day of

History of Present Illness:
Mrs ___ is a ___ female patient with a significant 
past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and 
hyperlipidemia who was admitted to OSH on ___ after an 
episode of presyncope, associated with shortness of breath, 
nausea, and left-sided rib pain radiating to her back and over 
her umbilicus. The episode occurred when she was cleaning her 
house.  She described the episode as feeling dizzy and cold. On 
questioning she admits to the chest pain and shortness of 
breath.  She described the pain as sharp and ___ in intensity. 
She denies ever experiencing similar chest pain before but 
states that she had a history of injury to her left ribs. She 
admits that her ability to complete daily activities has been 
limited by her fatigue, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis 
over the last year. She believes these symptoms have progressed 
over the last ___ years.  She can no longer walk as far as 
across the street without getting worn out.  She requires daily 
afternoon naps.  She always sleeps on an incline or in a chair 
which she attributes to her shortness of breath and her chronic 
back pain. She is uncertain of recent weight gain or swelling 
but states she has gain at least 20 lbs in the last ___ years. 

In the OSH she was given Demerol and Reglan in the ED with 
relief of her pain and nausea.  She was admitted to telemetry 
and ruled in for a NSTEMI with a peak troponin of 0.40.  She 
underwent a nuclear stress test and was found to have anterior 
and anteroapical perfusion defects with documented LVEF of 74%.  
Due to a complaint of R calf pain she underwent ultrasound which 
revealed no DVT. Pt was then transferred to ___ for cardiac 
catheterization.  
.  
On arrival to the floor after cardiac catheterization, pt denied 
any feelings of chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or 
palpitations.   On her review of systems, she denies any prior

COMMENTS:     
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system 
revealed no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary 
artery 
disease. The LMCA, LAD and LCx had no disease. The RCA had a 30% 

proximal stenosis. 
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided and 
right sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 29 mmHg, mean PCW of 
31 
mmHg, and RVEDP of 19 mmHg. There was severe pulmonary arterial 
systolic 
hypertension with PASP of 61 mmHg. There was mild systemic 
arterial 
systolic hypertension with SBP of 147 mmHg. The cardiac index 
was 
preserved at 2.2 L/min/m2. 
3. Left ventriculography revealed 2+ mitral regurgitation. The 
LVEF was 
calculated to be 72% with no wall motion abnormalities. 
4. Succesful closure of femoral access with ___ Angioseal device. 

  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery 
disease. 
2. Normal ventricular function. 
3. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. 
4. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. 
5. Severe pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension. 
.
___ ECHO: 
The atria are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened, especially towards the 
leaflet tips (charcteristic of the rheumatic valvulitis 
sequelae), but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is moderate valvular mitral 
stenosis. Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure 
half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation 
of true mitral valve area. Mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Rheumatic valvular disease with moderate mitral 
stenosis and moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo f with hx of HTN, HL, and DM presents to OSH with 
worsening dyspnea on exertion and acute chest pain. She ruled in 
for NSTEMI was transferred to ___ for cardiac catheterization. 

.  
#. CAD: No known diagnosis of CAD on arrival to OSH. Pt has 
multiple risk factors for coronary disease including HTN, HL, DM 
and history of tobacco abuse. Her presentation with SOB, 
atypical chest pain, nausea and diaphoresis were concerning for 
ACS.  Reports from OSH indicate positive cardiac enzymes with a 
troponin of 0.4 (per verbal signout). Stress test also reportly 
had anterior and anterior-apical changes. Cardiac cath performed 
on arrival to ___ showed no significant coronary artery 
disease.  Catheterizations did, however, show evidence of 
elevated pressures throughout the heart.  This likely indicates 
that it was not coronary occlusion that caused the elevated 
troponin rather heart failure.  Plavix and heparin were 
discontinued after cath and pt was continued on aspirin, 
betablocker, ACEI, and statin.
.  
#. Pump: No known history of heart failure.  However, clinical 
presentation, history, and cardiac cath results support 
diagnosis of diastolic heart failure. Pt reports elevated blood 
pressure at time of dyspneic episode that would support pump 
failure. Etiology of heart failure was undetermined at time of 
admission.  Pt had known potential for significant valvular 
disease given known MVP, history of Rheumatic fever, and MR 
identified on cath. Cardiac cath performed on admission showed 
markedly elevated pressures throughout the heart. Echo was 
performed the follow morning showing diastolic dysfuction as a 
result of mitral stenosis (see results).  Pt was placed on fluid 
restriction, low salt diet and started on a lasix gtt.  Symptoms 
greatly improved overnight with diuresis.  Pt was also managed 
with heart rate control to reduce pulmonary hypertension.  
Because pt responded so well to diuresis and rate control there 
is no indication for surgical intervention at this time. Pt will 
continue to be medically managed with metoprolol tartrate 150mg 
bid for rate control (goal heart rate 60) and lasix 40mg po bid 
for afterload reduction. Pt was counseling on maintaining a low 
sodium diet, fluid restriction and weighing herself daily.  Pt 
is to follow up with her primary care provider to have her blood 
pressure, heart rate, and electrolytes monitored on her new 
regimen.  She is also instructed to have biannual 
echocardiograms to evaluate the status of her mitral stenosis.
.  
#. Diabetes: poorly controlled; Home oral hypoglycemics where 
held in setting of catheterization; Pt was monitored with fsbs 
qachs and treated with lantus 25 u qpm and sliding scale humolog 
at meal time. Pt's blood sugars remained elevated throughout 
hospitalization (range from 200-400).  Pt instructed to resume 
home hypoglycemic regimen and diabetic diet at home with 
frequent glucose monitoring.  Pt is to follow up with primary 
care doctor to discuss augmenting her regimen if elevated sugars 
persist at home.

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: acute diastolic CHF secondary to mitral stenosis
Secondary: DM, HTN, HL

 
Discharge Condition:
Pt is hemodynamically stable. She ambulates without assistance 
and does not require supplemental oxygen.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to this hospital to undergo a cardiac 
catheterization.  The catheterization did not show any blockages 
in the blood vessels that supply the heart.  However, it did 
show that you have high blood pressures within your heart.  To 
determine why you have these elevated pressures you had an 
echocardiogram performed.  This showed a tight valve within your 
heart.  This is most likely the cause of your symptoms.  You 
were treated with medications to reduce the pressures within 
your heart and to make your breathing easier. You tolerated the 
medications well and it was determined that you are not in acute 
need for any surgical intervention at this time. You will need 
to continue some of these new medications after you leave the 
hospital.
.
During your hospitalization you developed a bladder infection in 
the setting of a bladder catheter.  The catheter was removed and 
you were started on a three day course of antibiotics.  You 
should complete this course at home and follow up with your 
primary care provider.
.
While inpatient your glucose was significantly elevated.  You 
were treated with insulin while inpatient.  You are advised to 
return to your home oral hypoglycemic regimen after you leave 
the hospital and to follow up with your primary care physician 
within one week to discuss changing your current regimen.  
Please check your glucose regularly and alert your primary care 
physician if you have a glucose above 400.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
1) INCREASE Metoprolol Tartrate to 150 mg by mouth daily
2) START furosemide (lasix) 40mg by mouth twice a day.
3) START bactrim-DS 1 tablet twice a day for four doses (last 
dose on ___ morning)
4) STOP Premarin.  Please discuss the need for this medication 
with your primary care physician before restarting.
.
Please continue all other medications as previously directed.
.
Please notify your physician or return to the hospital if you 
experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, 
palpitations, loss of consciousness, fever, chills, or any other 
symptom that is concerning to you.

History of Present Illness:
F w/ complicated PMH significant for DM2, ESRD on HD, gout, 
sleep apnea, asthma on 3L home O2, afib not on warfarin, chronic 
L achilles wound and L breast wound, sent from primary care for 
lethargy and fever. Pt was seen in ___ clinic for urgent care 
visit at which she described feeling feverish for 1 day and 
sleeping excessively during the day for ~5 days. She denies any 
chills, cough, chest pain. Reports having RUQ colicky abdominal 
pain w/ occasional nausea and vomited up breakfast once. Also 
reports having constipation for 5 days, though she did have one 
small bowel movement today w/ some blood on paper. Her daughter 
and her ___ were concerned that she was not as talkative and was 
falling asleeping in the middle of conversations, which they 
state is a major change from her normal. Per PCP note, ___ 
clinic vitals were BP 101/49, HR 83, Temp 102.1F. Her O2 sat on 
3L was 79-83%, then up to 100% on 5L, but ___ HR would dip to 
___ when she ""fell asleep"" in clinic and then back up to ___ 
when she would wake up. Pt reportedly arousable during these 
episodes, unclear what O2 sat was during espisodes, and no RR 
was documented. Pt was sent to ED for further evaluation.  
In the ED, initial vs were: 99.6F, HR 90, 119/65, 1, 99% 3L. Pt 
had RUQ tenderness w/ + ___ sign, clear lungs, no evidence 
of bradycardia, LLE more swolen than RLE with calf tenderness, 
unchanged from note on ___ visit, same per patient, when she 
nad negative doppler. Her chronic L achilles wound and L breast 
wound were examined and seemed infected. Labs were remarkable 
for WBC 13.5k, Hct 29 (baseline), AP 120, AST 87, Lactate 1.8. 
RUQ ultrasound showed cholelithiasis but no evidence of 
cholecystitis. Her chest XR showed significant bilateral 
pulmonary edema but unchanged from prior. She reportedly had 
guaiac positive stool in ED. Pt spiked a fever in ED to 101.6F. 
Surgery consult was called regarding her left breast wound, but 
they thought it was superficial infection and did not feel this 
was the source for her fevers. Culture was obtained in ED. Pt 
was started on IV vancomycin for empiric coverage of skin 
infections. She was also given IV fluids, and HR remained in 
___ and BP ___. Pt was admitted to medicine for 
further management.  
 
On the floor, vs were: 100.6F, 134/47, 96, 20, 97% 3L, 237 lb 
(bed)  
Pt reported pain in her R lateral side, reproducible on 
palpation. States that it hurt more than her chronic breast or L 
achilles wounds. Reported constipation. Otherwise felt at 
baseline. Reports having vomited once yesterday.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
 
Limited study due to body habitus, however there is no 
significant interval
change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema.
 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

___ ECHO

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus identified (better excluded 
by TEE).

___ KUB
IMPRESSION:
 
Focal loops of small bowel which are stacked and dilated in the 
left lower

 ___ CT abdomen w/contrast
IMPRESSION: 
Partial small bowel obstruction with the transition occurring 
over a long
segment of hyperemic and thickened small bowel with adjacent 
mesenteric edema
and fluid. These findings are concerning for a focal area of 
ischemia versus
infection. Other considerations would be an adhesion from which 
the bowel
recently ""untwisted"". Given the patient's significant arterial 
atherosclerotic

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ complicated PMH significant for DM2, ESRD on HD, gout, 
sleep apnea, asthma on 3L home O2, afib not on warfarin, chronic 
L achilles wound and L breast wound, sent from primary care for 
lethargy and fever.

# Lethargy: Patient had reported lethargy in clinic. In ED and 
on floor, patient had been completely awake and fully oriented. 
This was most likely from the E.coli that grew from her breast 
wound.  This was managed initially with vancomycin, 
ciprofloxacin and flagyl.  But once the cultures came back 
positive, vancomycin was discontinued as she only required 
gram-negative coverage. Her blood cultures are still pending. 
She had associated abdominal tenderness and CT imaging results 
were indicative of a small area of bowel ischemia. Given her 
A-fib without anticoagulation, it is possible she may have 
thrown a clot to her intestinal vasculature.  This was managed 
with 24 hours of bowel rest and resolved. An ECHO ruled out a 
myocardial thrombus. In-house her gabapentin was also 
discontinued due to its effects of lethargy.

 # intermittent bradycardia: Pt had reported episodes of 
bradycardia when she ""feel asleep"" in urgent care clinic, w/ HR 
down to ___, but then back up to ___ when awoken. Unclear 
what her O2 sat or RR was during these periods, but it is 
possible that her lethargy, possibly from opiate medications 
described above, led to worsening of her known obstructive 
apnea, and transient hypoxia, which may reduce heart rate. She 
refuses CPAP. In-house, her opiate dosing was decreased and 
gabapentin was discontinued.  Her heart rate was stable in the 
___. 

# atrial fibrillation: not on anticoagulation. Per daughter and 
PCP, this was due to concern that warfarin was making her breast 
and L achilles wounds worse, but her CHADS2 score is 4, which is 
high risk, though stroke was thalamic so possibly due to bleed.  
PCP to ___ with out-patient cardiologist and nephrologist to 
assess patient's current requirement for warfarin. PCP did reply 
in email explaining that he had a risk benefit conversation 
(especially given bleeding risk from calciphylaxis) about 
warfarin and that the patient and her family chose against 
warfarin after making an informed decision. 

# L achilles wound: Pt was just seen by podiatry ___, who 
felt wound had moderate amount of purulent type drainage with a 
slight odor, with fibrotic base of wound but no purulence and 
moderate exudate.  In-house managed with Aquacel Ag dressings.  
Patient has out-patient podiatry follow up.

#Left breast wound.  Chronic over a few months.  Being dressed 
by nurse at home. Slight odor. Fleshy erythema surrounding a 
crusted center. Biopsied prior to admission which was indicative 
of wound likely secondary to calcifilaixis from renal failure. 
Wound cultures also grow E.coli.  She was managed as above with 
ciprofloxacin and flagyl

Transitional issues:
-patient to continue cipro/flagyl until ___
-out-patient assessment for warfarin 
-out-patient podiatry appointment
-out-patient PCP ___ (PCP to please follow up blood 
cultures)
-out-patient cardiology appointment

significant weight loss (over 100 pounds in the past year), 
fatigue, generalized weakness, here for workup. He underwent 
___ on ___ (unrevealing), then push enteroscopy on ___, 
which showed chronic inflammation consistent with Crohn's 
disease. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
================
# Crohn's disease
# Chronic diarrhea and weight loss
# Perirectal abscess and fistula
He presented with a compelling story of weight loss and chronic 
diarrhea. Has had large workup, which has thus far been notable 
for positive Celiac markers HLA-DQ2/DQ8 without pathologic 
diagnosis of Celiac disease (including normal tTG-IgA) although 
he has been adherent to a gluten free diet. He has been told he 
has Celiac disease in the past. Push enteroscopy revealing for 
discontinguous and strictured jejunum which, in the setting of 
perirectal abscesses was consistent with Crohn's disease. Final 
path from push enteroscopy showed non-necrotizing granulomas and 
chronic enteritis. Old pathology report also suggestive of 
Crohns without intraepithelial leukocytes. He likely has had 
Crohns disease all along. Per gastroenterology, he was taken off 
gluten free diet and tolerated a regular diet in house without 
any issues. He was started on prednisone 40mg daily which he is 
to remain on until his follow up outpatient appointment with 
gastroenterology Dr. ___.

Regarding perirectal fistula, this was evaluated by our 
colorectal surgery team and with an MRI pelvis.  There is no 
drainable pocket for now.  He should be scheduled for outpatient 
colorectal surgery follow up in ___.  Recommend Dr. ___ 
___ this.

# Anorexia
# Severe Malnutrition
# Protein Losing Enteropathy 
# Hypoalbuminemia
Unintentional weight loss of ~60 lbs since ___ in the 
setting of poor PO intake and intermittent diarrhea. Low albumin 
of 1.9 consistent with severe malnutrition. Nutrition was 
consulted. Electrolytes were checked frequently and patient was 
monitored on telemetry for re-feeding syndrome and 
electrolyte-related arrhythmias. He temporarily required TPN to 
boost his nutrition and then was discontinued shortly 
thereafter. He tolerated a regular diet and was given vitamin 
supplementation daily.  He does NOT require a gluten-free diet.

# Cholecystostomy tube
Placed at ___ in ___ for conservative 
management of suspected cholecystitis (positive ___ sign, 
gallbladder distention of RUQUS, though no CBD dilation or 
pericholecystic fluid). Patient is a poor candidate for surgery 
given his overall deconditioning and poor nutritional status. 
Surgery was consulted and they recommended T tube cholangiogram 
which showed patent biliary tree and patent cystic duct. Surgery 
removed the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube without any 
further issues.

# Neutrophilic leukocytosis
Patient remained afebrile, HD stable, and normoxemic in room air 
without any localizing symptoms. Infectious workup negative. 
Likely leukemoid reaction vs demarginalization in setting of 
starting steroids.  WBC count on day prior to discharge 18.7.

# ___
Baseline Cr of 0.9 in ___, up to 1.4 on admission. 
Suspected to be pre-renal azotemia in the setting of poor PO 
intake and diarrhea. Resolved with TPN and fluids. Renal was 
consulted for additional assistance and they also recommended 
IVF.  Cr day prior to discharge is 1.3, likely his new baseline.

#LLE swelling: has had this for many years. Likely ___ 
hypoalbuminea and venous insufficiency. Low suspicion for 
cardiac etiology given unilaterality. Bilateral LENIs were 
negative for DVT. He was recommended to elevate the leg and wear 
compression stockings. His swelling improved with resolution of 
home Lasix and aldactone.

#Anemia: 
Normocytic, likely related to anemia of chronic disease, not 
iron deficient. No evidence of hemolysis.

# Atrial fibrillation
INR of 2.7 on admission. Decision made to stop anticoagulation 
with warfarin given CHADS2VASC of 1 (1 point for age). He was 
started on aspirin during this admission. He had intermittent 
tachycardia with movement thought to be the result of 
deconditioning rather than poorly controlled afib. He was rate 
controlled on metoprolol succinate 50mg daily and digoxin (dose 
reduced to 0.625 in setting of renal function).

#Hyperglycemia: developed in setting of steroids. Was controlled 
with minimal ISS.

#Melena: Developed following push enteroscopy procedure. 
Stabilized without intervention. He had no further episodes of 
melena thereafter.

#Transudative left pleural effusion: etiology appears to be 
consistent with hypoalbuminemic state. No clinical signs of 
heart failure. His nutritional status was optimized as above. He 
underwent a thoracentesis with IP to have 1L of fluid removed. 
Repeat CT showed reinflation of the lung with resolution of the 
pleural effusion. He will need continued follow up given 
likelihood of reaccumation.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

___:  chest x-ray:

An ET tube ends 4.4 cm above the carina at the thoracic inlet. 
An NG tube 
ends in the fundus of the stomach. 
Lung volumes are low. There is no focal consolidation, no 
pleural effusion 
and no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 

No displaced fractures are visualized in the thorax. 
  
PELVIS:  
No fracture 

___: chest x-ray:

 
The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the 
stomach. The patient is after recent abdominal surgery. Right 
internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. There is 
no pneumothorax. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is noted but 
there is overall improvement of the right lung aeration, may be 
consistent with resolution of contusion

___:  Chest CTA:

 IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Within limitation of suboptimal contrast bolus, there is no 
evidence of 
acute central pulmonary embolism. 
  
2. No evidence of acute aortic injury. 
  
3. Trace left pleural effusion. Bilateral opacification of lungs 
with some 
air bronchograms may represent compressive atelectasis; however, 
acute 
infectious process cannot be completely excluded and should be 
considered in the correct clinical setting. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman admitted to the Acute Care service s/p 
gunshot wound to his abdomen.  Initially admitted to an OSH, 
where he was intubated,  required intravenous fluids and blood 
products.  
 
Upon admission, he was found to have a hemo-peritoneum.  He was 
urgently taken to the operating room where he underwent an 
exploratory laparotomy and small bowel resection.  During his 
operative course, he required additional blood products.  He had 
an 1800cc blood loss.  He was monitored in the intensive care 
unit after his surgery where he required pressors for blood 
pressure support. Once his blood pressure stabilized, his 
pressors were weaned.   He was extubated on POD #1 and was 
maintained on antibiotics for 48 hours.
Social work services were consulted once he was extubated.

He was transferred to the regular floor on POD #2.  His 
post-operative pain was managed with Dilaudid PCA. He did have 
an isolated episode of decreased oxygen saturation related to 
his abdominal discomfort and his pain regimen was readjusted. He 
did experience abdominal distention with slow return of bowel 
function and received methylnaltrexone with passage of flatus.  
His PCA was discontinued once clear liquids were tolerated and 
his diet was gradually advanced.  He had adequate pain relief 
with oral Dilaudid and Tylenol.

He ambulated with some difficulty initially and required walking 
with a walker. Currently he is walking independently on his own 
but will be sent home with a walker if he needs it. His surgical 
wound is healing well.  His vital signs are stable and he is 
afebrile.  After an uncomplicated recovery he was discharged to 
his mothers home on ___ and will follow up in the Acute Care 
Clinic in 2 weeks.

___-SPINE: There is visualization of the skull base through T1. 
There is no evidence of acute fracture. However, anterior 
splaying of the intervertebral disc space at the C6-7 level is 
concerning for ligamentous injury. There is no 
spondylolisthesis. There is no paravertebral hematoma seen. 
  
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen. There is mild 
narrowing of the spinal canal due to posterior osteophytes at 
the C5-6 level and also due to disc osteophyte complex at the 
C7-T1 level. Uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet hypertrophy 
cause severe narrowing of the right neural foramen at the C4-5 
level. Uncovertebral hypertrophy causes moderate bilateral 
neural foramen narrowing at the C5-6 level. Uncovertebral and 
facet joint hypertrophy cause severe neural foraminal narrowing 
at the C6-7 level. 

CT HEAD: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Hypodensity in 
subcortical and periventricular white matter in right 
occipital/parietal region may represent chronic small vessel 
ischemia. MR may be performed for more sensitive evaluation of 
acute infarct if of clinical concern. 
  
CTA head/neck: Bilateral partially calcified plaques at carotid 
bifurcations, with at least 50% stenosis on the right. Left 
vertebral artery dominant, with intermittent flow seen in 
diminuitive right vertebral. Intracranial arteries patent; small 
basilar with patent PComs bilaterally. 3D reformats pending. 
Scattered rounded pulmonary opacities and atelectasis. Anterior 
splaying of C5-6. ETT/NGT. Ethmoid mucosal thickening & fluid in 
nasopharynx. 

CT Torso:
1. Multifocal pulmonary opacities concerning for multifocal 
pneumonia, although there is also likely a component of 
aspiration. Atelectasis involving right upper and bilateral 
lower lobes. ETT slightly low. 
2. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology. Colonic 
diverticula, without evidence of diverticulitis. 

___ Radiologic Studies
MR/MRA brain:
1. A small subcentimeter focus of increased signal on the 
diffusion-weighted image, which may represent a small acute 
infarct versus T2 shine-through artifact. As this is not 
definitely identifiable on other sequences, a followup study, 
can be considered to assess stability of this finding and 
confirming its nature. 
  
2. Very small caliber of the distal vertebral and basilar 
arteries, which is grossly unchanged since ___. Prominent 
posterior communicating arteries, supplying the posterior 
circulation. This appearance may relate to atherosclerotic 
disease, as described previously.

MR ___ spine:
The axial GRE sequence is limited due to motion artifacts. 
However, confirming the findings of the recent CT of the 
cervical spine, there is widening of the disc space anteriorly 
at the level of C6-C7 with disruption of the anterior 
longitudinal ligament, anterior disc herniation with increased 
signal within the disc, which can relate to edema. In addition, 
there is also evidence of injury to the anterior longitudinal 
ligament at the level of C5-6 with widening of the disc space 
anteriorly with increased signal of the disc, representing 
edema. There is also diffuse disc bulge with posterior central 
disc extrusion with superior migration. Theposterior 
longitudinal ligament is displaced anteriorly and has some 
increased signal within which can relate to edema or injury. 
There is effacement of the ventral thecal sac at this level, 
with moderate- severe compression on the cord. There is 
increased signal within the cord extending from the level of C4 
to C7 from cord edema versus contusion. This linear focus of 
increased signal noted posterior to the C5 body (___) can 
represent small edpidural hematoma. 
  
At C2-3, small central focal disc protrusion is noted. 
  
At C3-4 moderate-sized central disc extrusion is noted causing 
mild indentation on the ventral thecal sac. 
  
At C4-5, there is posterior spondylotic ridge with uncovertebral 
osteophyte causing mild indentation on the ventral thecal side 
and bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. At C4-5, there is also 
increased signal in the disc, with anterior disc herniation and 
possible injury to the anterior longitudinal ligament at this 
level as well. 
  
At C7-T1, the disc space is grossly unremarkable but not 
adequately assessed due to artifacts on the axial sequences. 
  
There is moderate amount of increased signal in the prevertebral 
soft tissues, representing edema versus hemorrhagic contusion. 
  
On the STIR sequence, there is also increased signal in the 
interspinous and the posterior spinous soft tissue at the level 
of C5 and C6, representing possible edema or injury to the 
interspinous and supraspinous ligaments (series 5, image 10). 
Patient is intubated, with increased signal from fluid in the 
sphenoid and the maxillary sinuses. 
  
In the left lobe of the thyroid, there are areas of increased 
signal intensity seen on the sagittal T2 (series 5, image 10; 
series 6, image 27), which represent cysts or adenoma, not 
adequately assessed.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initially admitted to ___ for critical care 
support.
Pt was evaluated by Ortho Spine service (Dr ___ and 
underwent 

___ 1. Fusion C4-C7.
        2. Anterior diskectomies at C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed male with a past 
medical history significant for hypertension, panhypopituitarism 
since a benign pituitary adenoma in ___, panic and anxiety, and 
BPH, who presents with an episode of left hand 
weakness/clumsiness this morning followed by an episode of left 
leg weakness this afternoon.
 
The patient was in his usual state of health this morning when 
he was trying to put an earring in his wife's ear.  While he was 
doing this, he noticed a sudden onset of a strange feeling in 
his left hand.  He is a little unclear about what this feeling 
was.  He believes there was perhaps some tingling or the 
sensation that the hand was asleep.  He also felt that he might 
be having some difficulty with coordination trying to get the 
earring in his wife's ear.  He is unsure if there was any actual 
weakness.  He stopped doing what he was doing and proceeded to 
shake the hand for a brief period of time.  He believes the 
sensation lasted for about a minute and then resolved.  After 
the episode had ceased, he was able to then put the earring in 
his wife's ear, a task which apparently requires some degree of 
dexterity. 
 
After that episode, he did not think anything of it and he 
continued to go about his day.  According to both he and his 
wife, the rest of the day was uneventful until the early 
afternoon when he went to fill a prescription at his pharmacy.  
The patient was driving in his car and he noticed when he was 
attempting to get out of the car, his left leg was both stiff 
and weak.  The patient has had a number of problems with left 
leg stiffness in the past; however, this was unlike other 
episodes.  He felt his left leg was dragging and he was unable 
to put any weight on it.  He was barely able to take a few steps 
before he felt he was going to give out and fall down.  However, 
someone in the pharmacy caught him and laid him down on the 
floor.  The patient felt that he would have fallen due to the 
lack of power in the left leg.  There was no pain with this 
episode.  The people in the pharmacy insisted that he stay on 
the floor for approximately ___ minutes.  During that time, 
the patient did not test the leg, so he is not completely sure 
how long the episode lasted.  After the ___ minutes had 
passed, he insisted that he could get up and was able to do so.  
At this point, he believes he was walking normally, although he 
did feel that his left leg was somewhat stiff.  However, at this 
point, the stiffness was not significantly different than his 
usual left leg stiffness.  He spoke with his PCP who recommended 
that the patient come into the emergency room.  The patient was 
able to walk to his car, get in his car, and drove to the ___ 
Emergency Room.  He believes he is back at baseline, although 
feels his left leg is slightly stiff currently.
 
The patient has never had anything like this happen before.  He 
has never had any problems with carpal tunnel syndrome or 
tingling or numbness in his hands either left or right.  The 
patient has for many years, although he is not clear for how 
long, had difficulty with his left leg and left leg stiffness.  
However, he has never experienced significant weakness like this 
in the past.  He does report that sometimes he has some 
difficulty lifting up his leg and needs to lower his pants down 
to get his leg into it and sometimes when getting out of a car 
will aid leg in lifting it out of the car.  The patient 
otherwise has not had any headaches.  He has had no other focal 
numbness or weakness besides the above-mentioned problems.  He 
had no difficulties with speech.  He has never experienced any 
episode like this before.  He has never had episodes of focal 
weakness in the past before either.
 

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred 
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, 
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties 
producing or comprehending speech.   No bowel or bladder 
incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.
  
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or 
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies 
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness, 
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. 
 No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

___
___
 
MRI Brain
IMPRESSION:
1. The non-contrast MRI of the brain demonstrates no acute 
intracranial
process. There are multiple T2 hypointense lesions which 
demonstrate gradient
signal artifact within the bilateral frontal lobes and the right 
pons which
are unchanged compared with the prior study in ___ and 
most
certainly represent occult vascular malformations
2. There is a severe short segment stenosis of the proximal 
right A1 segment
of the anterior cerebral artery. There are also other foci of 
intracranial
arterial stenoses to include the right MCA M2 branch and 
bilateral PCA
branches which are not typical for atheromatous disease. Even 
though these
are atypical in appearance for atheromatous disease, given the 
high incidence
of this disease, atheromatous etiology is still on the 
differential. Another
possibility is a vasculitis. Clinical correlation recommended.
 
MRI C-spine
IMPRESSION:
Multilevel cervical spondylosis with mild to moderate spinal 
canal narrowing
from C3-C4 through C6-C7 worst at C5-C6 as described above 
without abnormal
signal of the spinal cord. There is severe neural foraminal 
narrowing at the
right C4-C5 and C5-C6.
 
CT C-spine
IMPRESSION: Moderate degenerative disease of the cervical spine, 
without
""critical"" spinal canal stenosis.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Cervical Spondylosis/Canal Stenosis
Exam and history most consistent with this. Some confusion 
initially given left sided weakness in the context of a cavenoma 
in the right basis pontis, but cervical disease much more 
consistent with overall picture. Exam actually worsened after 
admission with increased leg stiffness/tone, left patella 
clonus, bilateral upgoing toes. Has not previously had neck 
pain. Exam worse than MRI, but flexion extension imaging not 
performed owing to worsening and concern for exacerbation. MRI 
c- and t- spine was performed, along with CT c-spine. 
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended Medrol steroid dose 
taper, rigid collar and muscle relaxants. Thus, hydrocortisone 
10 mg BID was held while Medrol started and will need to be 
restarted wihen Medrol completed. This resulted in hypertension 
which will need to be followed closely as below. Typical 5 mg 
diazepam daily was rescheduled as 2 mg q8h. His exam improved 
somewhat in rigid collar and with Medrol, but we felt that he 
was not sufficiently independent to return home. Thus, he is 
discharged to rehabilitation. We expect that further clinical 
improvement will be seen. He should be seen by Neurosurgery in 
clinic in two weeks. He should remain in an Aspen rigid collar 
until that time. 
 
Hypertension
Amlodipine was increased to 10 mg QD from 5 mg, enalapril to 20 
mg BID from QD and atenolol was changed to carvedilol given 
blood pressures around 200 systolic. This began prior to steroid 
treatment, but uptitration of these medications in part occurred 
during steroid treatment. It will be essential to follow his 
blood pressure closely and down-titrate medications if there is 
a fall in his blood pressure with steroid taper. 
  
Hypopituitarism
After adenoma and radiation in ___. Radiation is the likely 
cause of cavernomas, of which he has several (see MRI report). 
Testosterone and levothyroxine were continued. Hydrocortisone 
was held in the context of methylprednisolone treatment, but 
will need to be restarted immediately on completion of last dose 
Medrol, lest he become Addisonian. This is very important. 
 
BPH
Continued to exhibit urgency and small volume urination, with 
some worsening due to spinal disease. Condom catheter was used 
for much of the admission. Finasteride was continued.
  
Glaucoma
Ophthalmic medicatons were continued. 
  
Depression/Anxiety
Buspirone and celexa, along with diazepam were continued. He was 
quite anxious about his new gait difficulties, but this was 
appropriate and understandable. Thus, these longer-standing 
problems were not really active issues during the admission. 
 
Leukocytosis
Attributable to steroid dosing. No bands.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after a brief episode (that lasted for a few 
seconds) of left hand clumsiness and a few minutes of left leg 
stiffness. Your brain MRI did not show any stroke but did show 
small cavernomas which are vascular malformations. Your clinical 
condition worsened after admission and clinical findings were 
consistent with spinal stenosis with myelopathy. This was 
confirmed on imaging of your spine. You were seen by 
Neurosurgery who recommended against surgery at this time, and 
that you follow-up with them as an outpatient. Physical therapy, 
along with your Neurology Team, recommended a stay in 
rehabilitation.

SUMMARY STATEMENT
=================
Ms. ___ is a ___ with a limited past cardiac history who 
presented with NSTEMI found to have clean coronary arteries on 
LHC and a dilated, hypokinetic RV on TTE. Ms. ___ presented 
with typical anginal symptoms with mild troponin elevation and 
no ischemic EKG changes. She had a coronary angiography that did 
not show significant disease and an ECG that demonstrated RV 
dilation with depressed free wall contractility with a normal PA 
systolic pressure. She did not have any other anginal symptoms 
after presentation. The differential for her RV hypokinesis 
includes thrombus (through no intracardiac shunt), microvascular 
disease, vasospasm or focal myocarditis. Given resolution of her 
symptoms and improvement of her cardiac enzymes, she was 
discharge home with plan for follow up TTE in several months. 

====================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
# NSTEMI/Chest pain 
# RV Dysfunction
Ms. ___ presented with crushing substernal chest pain on two 
occasions in the 24 hours prior to presentation, occurring once 
while walking and once at rest. By presentation, she was chest 
pain free. However, she was found to have troponin-T elevation 
that peaked at 0.21 (her first lab drawn here) before 
downtrending. She did not have associated EKG changes 
(non-specific T wave inversions). LHC without CAD- making 
working diagnosis myocardial infarcation with non-obstructive 
coronary aterties (MINOCA), etiologies include myocarditis, 
thrombus, microvascular disease or vasospasm.

Etiology of isolated RV dilation and hypokinesis is unknown, 
though it is likely an incidental finding not related to her 
presentation. She did not have a intracardiac shunt that could 
help explain her findings. It is possible the etiology is 
secondary to a myocarditis, though it would be somewhat atypical 
to see isolated RV dysfunction. Vasospasm or transient thrombus 
are also on the differential. Primary pulmonary disease is less 
likely given her PASP was not elevated. She will be treated for 
primary prevention of CAD with ASA/statin. 

Of note, the patient experienced hypotension on two separate 
occasions shortly after oral Metoprolol. She should not be 
placed on beta blockade for that reasons. 
- ASA 81mg daily
- Atorvastatin 80mg daily
- D/c Metoprolol 12.5mg bid given hypotension with 
administration
- Repeat TTE in ___ to re-evaluate for RV dysfunction 

# Urinary tract infection
- U cx originally with mixed flora, subsequently grew >100k 
units E. coil resistant to Bactrim and ampicillin/augmentin. 
Treated for 3 d with IV CTX 1g.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you while you were admitted to ___ 
___. 

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were having chest pain and when you came to the hospital 
we found that you had evidence of damage to your heart, which 
made us worried you had blockages in the vessels of the heart. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- We did a coronary angiography (catheterization) that did not 
show any significant blockages in your heart. 
- We did an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) that showed 
some stretching of the right side of your heart. This does not 
require us to do anything now, but you will have another

Respiratory Therapy:
Placed pt on HFNC at 100% and 40L, pt tolerated fairly well, but 
pt became more labored and somnolent over time. ABG showed a 
respiratory acidosis. Pt intubated with a 7.5ETT with a 
glidescope. ETCO2 had a + color change. Initial settings VT 500; 
RR 18; FiO2 80%; PEEP 8cm. Pt had very high PIPs of 40-50cm 
initially with low exhaled VT 100-200ccs. VT lowered to 370cc 
and RR increased to 24 than 30 - PEEP and FiO2 remained the 
same. Pt given Albuterol MDI 6 puffs for wheezing and was 
suctioned for small amts of thick, yellow secretions. Sputum 
sample obtained and sent to lab. s/p VBG 7.___/121/27 -5. Vent 
settings changed to vT:500 RR:24 PEEP:8 Fio2:60%. Etco2:41mmHg.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with asthma, OSA on CPAP, 
CAD with prior MI, HTN, and GERD who was recently treated for 
CAP (___) who presented in respiratory distress ___ influenza 
A and status asthmaticus.

#Influenza A
#Status Asthmaticus
#Hypoxemic respiratory failure
He initially presented to ___ urgent care 
wheezing and saying he ""could not breathe,"" found to be in 
respiratory distress with HR 140s, RR 20, and SpO2 94% on 2L and 
was transferred to the ___ ED for further management. In the 
ED
he was found to be febrile to 101.8, tachycardic in the 130s, 
slightly hypertensive, and tachypneic at RR 35 requiring a NRB 
to maintain SpO2 in the ___. He was placed on HFNC at 100% and 
40L which he tolerated well initially but his breathing became 
more labored and he became more somnolent. BiPAP was placed. 
Despite this, he developed a worsening respiratory acidosis with 
VBG: pH 7.11, pCO2 85, HCO3 29 and was intubated for hypercarbic 
respiratory failure. For his hypercarbic respiratory failure he 
was started on oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, Duonebs, and 
antibiotics (ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and Zosyn x1). He was 
started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and 
ceftriaxone. These were discontinued on ___ as he had no overt 
evidence of bacterial pneumonia. He also received 3L IVF.  He 
was then admitted to the MICU. On arrival to the MICU he was 
hypotensive with SBPs in the ___. His lactate increased from 
2 to 17, although this was likely type B insetting of albuterol 
nebs. He was given 2L LR bolus and was started on 
norepinephrine. He was weaned off pressors within 24 hours. Due 
to high PIP due to breath stacking, he was paralyzed to optimize 
ventilation. He was extubated on ___. Called out to the floor on 
___, stable on room air. He was no longer wheezing and felt 
comfortable using nebulizers as needed at home.  He continued to 
improve and was discharged on a prednisone taper over 2 weeks. 
he was advised to follow up with his PCP ___ ___ weeks of 
discharge.

# Acute renal failure
Patient developed acute renal failure in setting of acute 
illness. Cr peaked at 1.4, now back to baseline of 1.0 on 
discharge.

# Hypertension
Labetalol was started in the ICU due to recent ___ preventing 
use of home ACEi after improvement in renal function his home 
lisinopril was resumed. He was discharged on both ACEI and 
labetolol and advised to follow up with PCP to determine if 
labetolol was still needed. 

# Macrocytic anemia
Hgb ___ during admission from a baseline normal Hgb (14.7). 
Likely partially some dilutional/iatrogenic anemia from blood 
draws and volume resuscitation. LFTs wnl. EtOH use is moderate. 
B12 and folate both normal
- recommend  repeat CBC as outpatient and if persists, consider 
additional work up

# Hypothyroidism
 - Continued home levothyroxine

# GERD
 - Was on IV PPI while intubated; resumed home omeprazole 20 mg 
daily after extubation and continued on discharge

# Gout
 - Continued home allopurinol ___ mg daily

# OSA
Home CPAP ordered.

# Tobacco use disorder
Patient reports he is planning to quit smoking after his severe 
illness.

Transitional issues:
- discharged on prednisone ___ call PCP to schedule 
follow up
- labetolol added to antihypertensive regimen
- recommend  repeat CBC as outpatient and if anemia persists, 
consider additional work up

Imaging: 
CT HEAD ___:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for an acute intracranial abnormality.

RIGHT FEMUR AP AND LATERAL ___:
IMPRESSION:  Comminuted and displaced intertrochanteric fracture 
of the right hip with varus angulation.  No fracture is 
identified elsewhere.  Severe osteopenia. 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of patchy opacities in the 
right lower lung compared with ___ ___s probable 
decrease in size of right effusion given supine position on the 
current exam.  Background emphysema and coarse interstitial 
markings likely related to fibrotic changes. 

CTA HEAD & NECK ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or large 
territorial 
infarction. 
2. No evidence of aneurysm > 3mm or dissection. 
3. Complete occlusion of the left subclavian artery at the level 
of the left vertebral artery origin.
4. Diffuse large vessel partially calcific atherosclerosis with 
severe 
stenosis of the proximal right subclavian artery. 
5. 7 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, not definitively 
identified on the previous Chest CTA. 
6. Bilatratal lobulated pleural effusions with adjacent 
atelectasis, 
bronchiectasis, airway secretions, and scattered airspace 
opacities. 

___ MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
MRI HEAD:  There is no evidence of acute infarction or 
hemorrhage. There is no mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus.  
Prominent ventricles and sulci are compatible with mild global 
age-related atrophy. FLAIR hyperintensities in the subcortical 
and periventricular white matter likely sequelae of chronic 
microvascular ischemic disease. Old infarct with volume loss is 
noted within the right temporal lobe. Principal vascular flow 
voids are preserved.  Globes and soft tissues are unremarkable. 
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well 
aerated. 
  IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage 

___ TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen 
(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The right 
atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>65%). 
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline 
normal free wall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at 
the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be 
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. 
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
the findings are similar.

___ ECG:
Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response. Modest 
diffuse  
ST-T wave changes that are non-specific. Poor R wave progression 
suggests 
anteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. 
Compared to the 
previous tracing of ___ wave changes 
appear to be 
improved. Otherwise, no other significant diagnostic change. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation who 
presented 3 days ago with R intertrochanteric fracture due to 
mechanical fall, now status post trochanteric-femoral nail whose 
post-op course was complicated by blood loss anemia, 
hypotension, and left subclavian arterial thrombus requiring 
thrombectomy. 

#Left subclavian arterial thrombus: Likely cardioembolic source 
given subtherapeutic INR. No history of arterial thrombi in 
past. Thrombocytopenia of new onset may suggest HITT, but she 
has clear other reasons and I feel that HITT would be much less 
likely than cardiac embolus. Additionally, platelets rebounded 
while on heparin. Transthoracic echo showed no ___. A 
hypercoaguable workup was not pursued as an inpatient, thinking 
that it would be low yield. She was restarted on home warfarin 
that she had been non-compliant with (admission INR 1.3), and 
bridged with heparin drip. 
   Of note, in the setting of her left arm arterial thrombus, 
stroke evaluation was undertaken before it was clear her arm was 
ischemic. She had no evidence of large vessel aneurysm or 
dissection on CTA of head/neck and, after her thrombectomy, an 
MRI of the head showed no acute infarct. 

#R hip fracture: Suffered from a mechanical fall at home landing 
on her right hip. She had trochanteric femoral nail placed on 
___. Post-op orders were for weight bearing as tolerated. 
Physical therapy saw the patient and recommended rehab for acute 
___. She has orthopedics follow up in ~2 weeks for repeat hip 
imaging. 

#Behavioral Changes: The family (3 children) were present for 
much of the admission. They expressed concern over their 
mother's perceived chronic to subacute personality changes. She 
had in the past months to ___ years become more forgetful and 
started not taking medications, such as warfarin, that she had 
been on for years. Their concern is that she still resides alone 
and is independent in ADLs, IADLs. However, she reportedly is 
not able to do tax papers reliably any longer, which is a change 
from previous years. The description of her slow decline sounds 
most consistent with incipient dementia. We had this 
conversation with the family and patient. Her neurologic exam 
was intact, though behaviorally she demonstrated inability to 
retain some basic facts of her hospital care. Neurocognitive 
evaluation was not undertaken.   
   Reversible causes were not investigated during this acute 
hospitalization, though she should have reversible causes of 
dementia ruled out as an outpatient. 

#Acute blood loss anemia: Hemoglobin was 11mg/dL on admission, 
but was near 15 last month. Much of this is likely acute blood 
loss from hip surgery in addition to left subclavian arterial 
thrombectomy. Her MCV is normal. She had a colonoscopy in ___ 
with polyps and diverticuli and EGD ___ that was normal. She 
would benefit from serial monitoring every month or so to 
demonstrate return to baseline. 

#Thrombocytopenia: Normal at 159 on admission, then dropped down 
to nadir of 108. Her platelets were 145 on day of discharge. 
Though HITT was considered and discussed extensively by Dr. ___ 
___ vascular surgery, and discussed again with Dr. ___ 
Dr. ___ likely represents consumption from blood loss and 
surgery, with HITT being quite unlikely given rebound of 
platelets while on continuous heparin infusion. Drop and timing 
of rebound is also typical of post-opereative recovery.  Have 
recommended that CBC be monitored at rehab for the next ___ 
days.

#Diastolic CHF: TTE showed findings similar to prior with normal 
LVEF, moderate PA systolic hypertension, and 1+ AR. She had been 
getting both Lasix 20mg daily and developed low blood pressure 
post-operatively, likely from some bleeding. Therefore, her 
Lasix was held. This should be given if she develops any signs 
of hypervolemia, worsened respiratory status, or elevated 
jugular veins. She appeared euvolemic at discharge.

#AFib with RVR: History of atrial fibrillation for years. She is 
on diltiazem for rate control and warfarin. Her CHADS2 score is 
2. She has been non-adherent per family for unclear reasons, 
though possibly related to early dementia. She was started 
emergently on heparin gtt for subclavian arterial thrombus. 
Heart rates were well controlled in 90-110s. Her diltiazem ER 
360mg dose was lowered for a few days because of borderline 
blood pressures (90s-100s). This should be titrated back up to 
her home dose of 360 mg.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
#COPD: Home 2 liters O2. Chemistries showed elevated HCO3 
consistent with chronic CO2 retention. Continued home inhalers 
and O2.

#Left pleural effusion: Seen on imaging. Unclear etiology. Of 
note she has a history of RML lung nodules thought to be likely 
___ s/p radiofrequency ablation in ___. Subsequently she 
has had a history of bilateral effusions R>L. She has had 
extensive workup, including pleural biopsy in ___ ___s 
pleural cytology, both of which were negative for malignancy. 
Prior to that in ___ she had work up of pleural fluid that 
was negative for lymphoma/leukemia cells. Additionally, she had 
cytology in ___ that was likewise negative. 

#Pulmonary nodules: History of multiple CTs for past few years 
with multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally. Last CTA chest in 
___ showed a stable 12 mm ground-glass nodule in right lower 
lobe since ___ and yearly followup was recommended. This 
admission, CTA neck showed a new 7 mm, not definitively 
identified on the previous Chest CTA. These should be evaluated 
with chest CT in ___ year.

#Hypothyroidism - Continued levothyroxine supplement.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your admission 
to ___. As you know, you were 
admitted after you fell and were noted to have a hip fracture, 
which was repaired. You developed weakness in your left arm that 
was found to be due to a blood clot in one of the blood vessels 
that supplies your arm, prompting removal of the clot and 
improvement in your symptoms. Although there was initial concern 
that arm weakness was due to a stroke, MRI of your brain was 
ultimately reassuring that you did NOT have a stroke. 
Nevertheless, it is very important that you take warfarin 
(Coumadin) as directed to prevent future blood clots like the 
one you had in your left arm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ h/o ETOH cirrhosis c/b HRS s/p liver-kidney 
transplant ___, w/ subsequent chronic liver rejection s/p liver 
transplant ___ on MMF, tacro, and prednisone who was admitted 
for mild acute liver rejection on biopsy and transaminitis - 
thought to be due to missed doses of immunosuppressants. While 
hospitalized, he had a steroid burst with high dose IV 
Methylprednisolone. He was subsequently transitioned to PO 
Prednisone 20mg daily, and is to be slowly tapered in clinic. He 
tolerated the increased doses of steroids well. 

# ETOH cirrhosis c/b HRS s/p liver-kidney transplant ___, c/b 
chronic liver rejection
# S/P liver transplant ___:
# Mild acute transplant rejection:
Mild acute rejection on biopsy ___ with new elevations in LFTs. 
No obvious trigger other than medication non-compliance. Issue 
with timing of medications discussed at length with patient. 
Notable studies that were negative included: EBV mono spot, CMV 
VL, infectious work up including UCx (BCx pending at discharge). 
As such, he was given a steroid burst with IV Solumedrol 1g 
daily x3 day ___ and was transitioned to a higher dose 
of PO Prednisone 20mg qd afterwards. He is to take 20mg 
Prednisone from ___ - ___, and then 17.5mg Prednisone from ___ 
- ___, and then Prednisone 15mg from there after. He was also 
started on Valgancyclovir for CMV prophylaxis, as well as 
continued on Bactrim DS QOD for PCP/Toxo prophylaxis. He was 
continued on MMF 500mg BID and Tacrolimus (daily levels 
monitored and doses were adjusted accordingly). His Tacrolimus 
level at discharge was 4.2 and he was discharged on Tacrolimus 
5.5mg BID. His transaminitis initially improved with the steroid 
burst, and at discharge were AST 36 and ALT 79. 

# ESRD s/p liver-kidney transplant
Cr baseline most recently ~2.2-2.6 with evidence of stable but 
present DSAs. His creatinine was monitored daily, and ultimately 
his home Losartan was held during his hospitalization (as well 
as at discharge). 

#Chronic metabolic acidosis:
Secondary to ongoing diarrhea due to short gut syndrome and MMF. 
Continued home Bicarbonate 1950mg BID supplementation. 

#Short gut syndrome
Continue home Loperamide PRN. Held home Lomotil during his 
hospitalization, but this was restarted at discharge. 

#Hypertension 
Held home Losartan in the setting of ESRD, however continued his 
home Nifedipine.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ hx of 10 cardiac stents per pt report, 
esophageal spasms, HTN, HLD, prior CVA per epic records, 
depression on Prozac, DM (HBA1C 12.1% on ___ who presents to 
___ ED with report of chest pain.  

Patient states that he was sitting at his sister's home at 4pm 
sitting at rest, reading a screenplay, when he had substernal 
squeezing chest pain. Sometimes he has similar pain with 
esophageal spasms, but this chest pain became asso with numbness 
in his left hand and left jaw discomfort and progressively 
worsened. States it does not feel entirely like his esophageal 
spasms and that it is similar to prior angina asso with 
catherization albeit less pronounced. Took SLN at home with no 
effect, just SLN asso headache. No asso with 
nausea/vomiting/diphoreisis, but ""pronounced"" SOB per his 
report. Denies lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, sweats, 
peripheral edema, URI sx, fever, abdominal pain, palpitations. 
He states that his chest pain did not improve until Dilaudid 
administered in the ED.  

According to Partners records, he initially presented on ___ 
to ___ ED. There, his EKG was remarkable only for SR 110 
inferior/apical TWF similar to prior studies, labs with negative 
trop x 2, transaminitis in 70-80 rang, c/w prior, CXR 
unremarkable. Per the ED note ""...I do not see any obvious 
explanation for the pain, certainly there is nothing specific in 
the history of exam to indicate PE, ACs, PNA, etc. It is 
suppose, posssible that opiate dependence is playing a role 
here. He was certainly quite insistent regarding pain relief, 
and specifically 2mg of Dilaudid IV and 1 mg of Ativan IV. He 
became quite irate when I told him that this was not an option 
for us this evening. I have counseled the pt in this regard. We 
contacted his cardiology, ___, here at the ___ to 
apprise her of his visit here ...""  

Shortly thereafter, he presented to the ___ ED for further 
management.  
In the ED, initial vital signs were: 97.7 100 155/89 19 99%RA  
- Exam was notable for: AA&o3, nontoxic RRR; CTAB; abd s/nt/nd; 
no ___ edema; skin + psoriasis  
- Labs were notable for: anemia 11.0/34.1; glucose 213. Trop neg 
x 1  
- Imaging: CXR clear  
- The patient was given: SLN x1, dilaudid 0.5 x 2; GI cocktail.  

As the patient stated in the ED that he had taken a full aspirin 
prior to arrival, he was not administerd further ASA.  

Upon arrival to the floor, patient complaining of chest pain, 
jaw discomfort and left hand tingling. Repeat EKG on floor 
unchanged from prior. Trialed another SLN with no improvement. 
Given diluadid with improvement. On medication reconciliation, 
it was found that he only takes a baby ASA, and therefore was 
given a full 325mg of ASA on arrival.  

In regards to his rash, he states that this is his baseline and 
attributes this to psoriasis. Has prior history of malignant 
melanoma and therefore not a candidate for light therapy. Not on 
MTX. He states that whenever he gets pain, his rash worsens. 
Slightly pruritic, but overall the pt is not bothered by this 
rash.

CARDIAC CTRESS ___
INTERPRETATION: This ___ yo NIDDM man with h/o CAD, s/p multiple 
PCIs, was referred to the lab from the inpatient floor following 

negative serial cardiac enzymes for evaluation of chest 
discomfort and 
dyspnea on exertion. The patient exercised for 6 minutes of a 
Modified 
___ protocol and was stopped at the patient's request for 
shortness of 
breath. The estimated peak MET capacity was 4.6, which 
represents a poor 
exercise tolerance for his age. The patient presented to the lab 
with a 
___ central chest discomfort that increased to ___ in late 
exercise 
and remained at that level throughout recovery. Progressive 
dyspnea was 
reported by the patient during exercise and early recovery. 
There were 
no significant ST changes noted during exercise or recovery. 
Rhythm was 
sinus with one VPB in recovery. There was a blunted heart rate 
and blood 
pressure response to exercise in the presence of beta blockade. 
IMPRESSION: Atypical symptoms in the absence of ischemic EKG 
changes. 
Poor functional capacity limited by dyspnea. Blunted hemodynamic 

response. Nuclear report sent separately. 

CARIAC PERFUSION ___ IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion 
with no reversible defects at the level of exercise achieved.  
2. Slightly increased left ventricular cavity size and decreased 
left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, previously 59%. 

ECG ___
Sinus rhythm. Inferior wall myocardial infarction of 
indeterminate age. 
Possible prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction of 
indeterminate age. 
Non-specific ST segment changes. Compared to the previous 
tracing of ___  the ventricular rate is slower  

CXR ___ FINDINGS:  
Cardiomediastinal silhouette including mild cardiomegaly is 
unchanged.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.  Bones are grossly unremarkable. IMPRESSION:  No 
acute intrathoracic abnormality. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx of HTN, HLD, DM2 and CAD s/p PCI and esophageal spasms 
admitted for ACS rule out. 
# Chest pain: S/p ASA 325 mg x 1. Chest pain atypical in 
presentation-- did not start with exertion, not relieved by SLN. 
EKG without new ischemic changes and troponin negative x 2. Of 
note, per Partner's ___ review, pt was seen in ED and also ruled 
out for ACS at ___. Aditionally, pt had repeat episode of chest 
pain overnight. EKG once again unchanged and troponin/CK-MB 
negative. However, given that pt endorses new DOE, concern for 
progression of CAD and therefore underwent stress/MIBI. Stress 
test with atypical symptoms in the absence of ischemic EKG 
changes. Poor functional capacity limited by dyspnea. Imaging 
notable for normal myocardial perfusion with no reversible 
defects at the level of exercise achieved, though slightly 
increased left ventricular cavity size and decreased left 
ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, previously 59%. No 
evidence of heart failure on exam and therefore encouraged to 
follow-up with outpatient cardiologist. 

#Esophageal spasms: Likely a contributor to chest pain. CCB 
considered for hx of esophageal spasm, however pt has tried 
diltiazem without relief in past, and is already on amlodipine. 
Home nitrate was uptitrated: imdur 120 mg QD increased to imdur 
180 mg QD, and he was encouraged to follow up with outpatient 
GI. 

===transitional issues====
-IMDUR 150 increased to IMDUR 180 QD to improve esophageal 
spasms. 
-LFTs mildly elevated: AST 45, ALT 66. Nml alk phos and t.bili.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You came to the hospital because you were having chest pain. The 
largest thing we worry about is a heart attack, particularly in 
you since you have had prior stents placed in your coronary 
arteries before. Thankfully, your EKGs did not show any evidence 
of a heart attack, nor did the markers for cardiac dysfunction 
in your blood, even after a repeated episode of chest pain you 
had overnight. Therefore, your symptoms are not from a heart 
attack. Unfortunately, we are unable to tell you what is causing 
them exactly; likely it is a component of your esophageal 
spasms, and therefore we have uptitrated your home nitrate. We 
have increased the dose of your isosorbide mononitrate from 120 
mg to 180 mg daily. Please follow-up with your outpatient 
gastroenterologist since he knows your esophageal spasm history 
the best, as well as your PCP to maintain overall good health. 

We wish you the best,
-Your ___ care team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after 
a fall and were found to have a right scapular (shoulder blade) 
fracture and multiple right-sided rib fractures.  Your scapular 
fracture will heal on it's own and you have an appointment in 
the outpatient ___ clinic for repeat imaging.  Your rib 
fractures will heal on their own and it is important to use your 
incentive spirometer to prevent pneumonia.  

You have worked with Physical Therapy who recommend you be 
discharged to rehab to regain your strength. 

You are now ready to be discharged from the hospital.  Please 
note the following discharge instructions:

* Your injury caused right-sided rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
Overnight on POD#0, the patient was unable to void and had to be 
straight cath'ed x1.  He was able to void thereafter.  On POD#2, 
the patient was complaining of calf tenderness.  He was sent to 
rule out a blood clot.  His LENIs were negative for blood clots. 
 Urines were also collected on POD#2 when his white count and 
temp were elevated.  His urinalysis was negative and urine 
culture was pending at time of discharge.  He will be contacted 
if the urine culture comes back positive.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The surgical 
dressing was changed and the SIlverlon dressing was removed on 
POD#2. The surgical incision was found to be clean and intact 
without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen 
daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the 
hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity. Please use walker or 2 
crutches at all times for 6 weeks.

Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to be part of your care.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having fevers

obstruction and infection of your biliary drain. Your drain was 
replaced and you were started on antibiotics (now 
ciprofloxacin/augmentin) to treat your infection. Later during 
your stay the drain replacement was found to be partially 
clogged, so you underwent a second drain exchange and a larger 
drain was place. 

Please continue taking the antibiotics for a total 14 days 
(dating from your drain exchange), so your last day of 
antibiotics will be ___. 

If you experience any further infectious symptoms such as fever 
or chills or any symptoms related to your drain site such as 
redness or pus around your drain site, please contact your 
primary doctor.

It was a pleasure to be part of your care,

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, the patient is a ___ female with history of 
recurrent pulmonary emboli, lupus anticoagulant, asthma, common 
variable immunodeficiency and longstanding depression/PTSD, who 
was admitted after having a fall off of her desk chair with a 
resulting painful left buttock hematoma. This event occurred in 
the  setting of a recent supratherapeutic INR. After ED 
presentation, the patient also complained of some additional 
atypical chest pain of unclear etiology. Hospital course details 
outlined more fully below:
.
# Questionable Cellulitis/Abscess: Given her MRSA history and 
CVID, the ED staff was intially concerned with infection. 
However, she had no leukocytosis or fevers. ED staff consulted 
surgery service who opted to perform a left buttock I&D due to 
concerns that there may be an underlying abscess after there was 
a questionable collection noted on ultrasound. The 1 inch 
incision site drained blood but no observable pus or discharge. 
Later, after her transfer to the floor the patient was seen by 
the surgical service who re-dressed the wound and took a wound 
culture. Because she had no fevers or WBC elevations antibiotics 
were not continued. Initially it was felt that she just had a 
deep hematoma. She was discharged with ___ and daily wound care 
instructions. Blood cultures at time of discharge were negative 
to date. Wound culture final results were pending but wound gram 
stain showed no microorganisms, no leukocyes/PMNs. 
Unfortunately, the day after discharge she had cultures that 
grew out MSSA. PCP was contacted with update as the patient has 
a scheduled follow up planned for ___. The patient may need 
to be placed on an antibiotic regimen, particularly given her 
open wound and CVID history.  
.
#Left Buttock Hematoma: The patient had been placed on long term 
Warfarin therapy for recurrent PE history and known lupus 
anticoagulant. Of note, her most recent INR was supratherapeutic 
at 5.42 on ___. Around the same time, a week before her 
admission she explained that she fell out of her desk chair in 
her kitchen. She developed a large, expanding left buttock 
hematoma soon afterwards and had a brief admission to ___ 
___ and a few doses of her Warfarin were held. Upon 
admission to ___ she had an INR of 1.9 so the medicine team 
decided to continue her daily doses while she was an inpatient. 
She had a decline in her Hct from initial 27 down to 24 range 
after a lot of IVFs and bleeding in the setting of her I & D 
procedure. She also arrived to the medical floor with systolic 
blood pressures in the ___ range. She was asymptomatic despite 
fleeting hypotension. This was likely because of the multiple 
pain medications she had received in the ED. However, in the 
setting of a recent I& D and bleeding the team transfused her 
with 2 Units of blood. After this her Hct rose from 24 to 33 and 
then stabilized to about 30 by the time of discharge.  For pain 
management she was ultimately switched from all IV narcotics 
which were promoting bouts of hypotension to a lidocaine patch 
and then to PO Dilaudid by hospital day #2 which worked very 
well and achieved excellent pain relief according to the 
patient. Thus, she was continued on an additional 10 days of PO 
Dilauded upon discharge. She had her wound dressing changed BID 
and ice packs were given for additional comfort. ___ services 
were arranged for ongoing outpatient dressing changes, wound 
checks and INR lab draws.  
.
# Hypotension: The patient had some intermittent episodes of 
hypotension soon after transfer to the medical floor from the 
ED. There were some initial concerns for sepsis but in the 
absence of fevers, normal lactate levels and no leukocytosis 
this seemed unlikely. She was given Morphine, Fentanyl, 
Percocet, and Dilaudid within hours of each other. Thus, her low 
blood pressures were mainly a result of multiple pain 
medications. She responded very well to IVFs and her blood 
pressure medications and IV narcotics were all held until her BP 
stabilized. Fortunately, she remained asymptomatic and was in no 
distress despite SBPs in the mid to high ___ at times. She 
recovered gradually and by hospital day 2 she was normotensive. 
By hospital day 3 and 4 she was restarted back on her home 
Lasix. The rest of her blood pressure medications were restarted 
after discharge. 
.
# Atypical Chest Pain:  Per OMR noted the patient has been noted 
to have a chest pain syndrome of unclear etiology. She 
complained of chest pain that was at her lower sternum and 
radiating towards her back that oscillated between sharp pains 
and dull aches and lasted ""hours"" and sometimes days. A CTA was 
negative for PE/dissection and she was continued on Coumadin for 
her history of PE. She maintained healthy oxygen saturation 
levels between 93-97% on room air during her hospital stay. 
Three sets of cardiac enzymes returned negative, so ACS 
essentially ruled out. Follow up EKGs and telemetry were benign. 
CXR also unremarkable. She was written for  SL nitroglycerin but 
had no acute CP episodes after arrival to the floor. An exercise 
stress test was postponed given her negative cardiac workup to 
date and her inability to exercise without a lot of left buttock 
pain given her extensive hematoma. Thus, she was set up for an 
outpatient cardiac follow up with Dr. ___ at  ___ in 
___ who will review her complaints in more detail in the 
outpatient setting. She was continued on her usual Aspirin and 
her beta blocker was eventually restarted. 
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit baseline in low ___ and went to ___, then 
24. Gave patient 2 Units of blood on ___ and Hct rose to 33 
again, and was 30 at time of discharge. Blood loss was likely 
from the initial I&D of her hematoma site. Some of her Hct drop 
was related to pure dilutional effects with generous IVFs given 
in the setting of her low BPs after a plethora of pain 
medications.  Serial Hcts were monitored, and her wound site was 
assessed several times daily for any active bleeding. 
.
# Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID): Chronic condition. 
Splenomegaly noted on CTA. She has ongoing IVIG monthly 
infusions for managment. 
.
# Question of diastolic CHF : It is unclear whether patient 
actually has history of congestive heart failure per cardiology 
notes. However, she states that she has diastolic dysfunction. 
She was continued on her usual home lasix dosing after her blood 
pressures stabilized on hospital day ___. She will plan to 
follow up with her new cardiologist in a few weeks to explore 
additional testing and management. 
.
# Pulmonary Embolism history: Admission INR subtherapeutic at 
1.9. She was continued on her usual Coumadin therapy. Oxygen 
saturations were typically >95% on room air and she had no 
shortness of breath complaints. Moreover, CTA was negative for 
any pulmonary embolisms. Daily INR /___ levels were monitored and 
she was discharged with instructions for BID ___ checks 
through her home ___ services. 
.
#Depression: According to records the patient has a history of 
sexual abuse and PTSD as well as multiple psychiatric 
hospitalizations for despression and suicide attempts. She 
denied a history of borderline personality disorder and asked 
that it be eliminated from her PMH. This was addressed and she 
was advised to discuss this with her PCP as the medical team had 
limited background on this diagnosis. She had no signs of 
tearfulness or labile mood changes during this hospital stay. 
She also denied suicidal thoughts. She was continued on her 
usual doses of fluoxetine, klonopin, trazodone. 
.
#Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Despite this label per medical records 
she stated that she does not use any CPAP or BIPAP at home. 
Therefore she was monitored with oxygen saturation checks with 
vital signs but otherwise no additional interventions taken on 
this admission. 
.
#CTA breast finding : A small soft tissue nodular opacity was 
noted in the left breast measuring approximately 10 mm. Prior 
mammogram reports from ___ note a right sided region that had 
been biopsied and fibroadenoma identified but no left sided 
pathology noted. Thus, this new area of nodularity in left 
breast warrants follow-up with her PCP as outpatient (notified). 
No appreciable axillary lymphadenopathy on physical exam but 
full breast exam was not performed during this inpatient stay.  
.
# Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Electrolytes were 
monitored and repleted daily as needed, she was placed on a 
cardiac healthy diet PO, IVFs were also given for low blood 
pressures as needed for any fleeting hypotension with pain 
medications.
.
# Prophylaxis:
-She was continued on Warfarin anticoagulation therapy and 
PE/DVT prevention
-She was continued on her usual home PPI (Omeprazole BID)for now 
for her history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
-PO Dilaudid for pain control
-Senna/Colace were provided for a bowel regimen.
. 
#Code Status/Communication - Lastly, the patient was maintained 
as a full code status for the entirety of her hospital course 
and communication occurred on a daily basis directly with the 
patient.

History of Present Illness:
___ PMH of Sarcoidosis, Clotting Disorder (Unclear Type, c/b 
PEs, CVAs, LLE infarct s/p amputation), DM (HbA1c 11.8), who 
presented to ED w/ pleuritic CP, found to have large PE and 
Hyperglycemia and was admitted to medicine for further workup.  
In looking at pt's visit notes from ___, pt noted right 
sided abdominal pain radiating to the chest, and her PCP was ___ 
PE given clotting hx, so rec'd CT Chest but was not completed. 
Today, she presented to ED c/o pleuritic left sided chest pain 
of sudden onset starting at 6pm a/w SOB, left sided chest pain, 
diaphoresis, same as symptoms a/w prior PE's so was concerned 
and came to ED. Of note, pt is active tobacco user, and had a 
recent flight from ___ to ___ 2 days ago.  
W/ regard to clotting disorder, has a family history with father 
and grandmother who had multiple clots including CVA/PE. She 
reports extensive w/u of which we dont have records but said 
they concluded it was due to her sarcoid, despite the fact that 
she is the only member in her family with both sarcoid and 
clotting issues. As per her report, had initial clot ___ yrs ago, 
was on coumadin for ppx, but then had CVA while INR therapeutic 
so was siwtched to lovenox. She continued on lovenox for several 
years without issue and providers weaned her in ___ given that 
she had no events. <6 months after weaning, experienced a 
arterial thrombus in LLE requiring 6 surgeries and eventual 
amputation. She was then restarted on lovenox given prior 
success but experienced PE ___ year later and had to be switched 
to Fondaparinux. She has continued on the Fondaparinux until 
now.  
In ED, initial VS were: 98.3 112 126/77 28 100% 2L Nasal Cannula 
but was quickly weaned to room air. On EKG was noted to have NSR 
@ 120, LAD, no TWI, 1mm ST depressions II. Labs significant for 
WBC 12.9, HCO3 20 (AG 16), Lactate 1.5, GLC 436, +Ketones in 
urine, but otherwise negative UA. Coags normal. CTA chest 
identified large central pulmonary embolus within the main 
pulmonary artery, extending  
to the left main, left upper lobar, lingular, and left lower 
lobar pulmonary w/ mild straightening of the intraventricular 
septum ___ right heart strain, and mild pulmonary edema.  
Given her PE, pt was started on IV UFH w/ bolus and given 2L NS. 
She was given IV dilaudid for pain. For hyperglycemia, pt was 
given 8U of humalog. Repeat Labs showed pH of 7.37 (VBG) HCO3 24 
but Glc still >300 so given 10 units humalog  
On the floor: pt noted that she has continued pleuritic chest 
pain which hurts when coughing or taking deep breath.

Imaging:
-------
CTA- IMPRESSION: 
 
1. Large central pulmonary embolus within the main pulmonary 
artery, extending
to the left main, left upper lobar, lingular, and left lower 
lobar pulmonary
arteries. Mild straightening of the intraventricular septum is 
concerning for
right heart strain. An echocardiogram may be helpful for further 
evaluation.
 
2. Mild pulmonary edema.
 
3.  Subpleural cystic changes in an apico-basal gradient with 
reticulation in
a peribronchovascular distribution raises concern for early 
fibrotic lung
disease such as NSIP.  Recommend pulmonology consult for further 
evaluation.

Echo- The left atrial volume index is normal. A right-to-left 
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen after intravenous 
injection of agitated saline injection at rest. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Right-to-left shunt at rest. Mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Normal 
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.

c/b PEs, CVAs, LLE infarct s/p amputation), DM (HbA1c 11.8), who 
presented to ED w/ pleuritic CP, found to have large PE and 
hyperglycemia and was admitted to medicine for further workup.  
She was started on heparin drip and then bridged to warfarin 
with INR goal of 2.5 to 3.5.  

#Pulmonary Embolism: Submassive given right heart strain noted 
on CT but not noted on echo. Patient with history of both venous 
and arterial clots, with family history of multiple clotting 
disorders.  In review of her work-up from ___, she has not been 
off anticoagulation to allow for work-up of her clotting 
disorder.  Per review of records, she has clotted through plavix 
and fondaparinux despite reported adherence.  Also clotted 
through warfarin that was at goal (however, INR goal unknonw). 
Patient with additional risk factors including DM and smoking 
but likely patient has underlying familial clotting disorder. 
Given history of multiple spontaneous abortions, concominant 
sarcoid, anti-phospholipid syndrome high on differential.  
Heme-onc was consulted.  She was started on heparin and bridged 
to warfarin with goal INR 2.5-3.5. She also continued on plavix. 
 

# Hematuria: Patient complaining of assymptomatic hematuria. U/A 
with RBCs but not clean catch.  She will need hematuria work-up 
as outpatient.  

#Hyperglycemia/DM uncontrolled: ___ 220-225. Pt w/ difficult to 
control diabetes w/ recent HbA1c of ~11%, on BID lantus and 
large HISS as per last ___ note. Most likely complicated by 
concurrent prednisone use. Given elevated AG, Ketones in Urine 
and Glc >400, ___ DKA but later VBG showed pH of 7.37 and HCO3 
of 24. Given 8U in ED initially, then 10U thereafter and 2L NS 
to restore intravascular volume as above. Her ___ remained 
elevated 200-300 during stay. Her lantus was not changed but 
increased sliding scale during stay.  Januvia was held. 

# Chest pain: Presented with chest pain, negative troponins, 
stable EKG. Unclear etiology. Could be from sarcoid. Unlikely 
further PEs as patient anticoagulated. 
Pain control with: 
- oxycodone 5 mg q 4 PRN(with hold parameter for sedation, 
RR<12)
- tylenol ___ mg q 4 PRN
-  tramadol PRN

# Hepatitis:Patient with elevated LFTs during stay. No right 
upper quadrant pain. RUQ deferred during stay but should be done 
as outpatient if LFTs remain elevated. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

#Sarcoidosis
Unclear severity, previously cared for at ___, has not 
established care w/ rheumatologist at ___.
-Continued prednisone/MTX at home dose
-Continued inhalers, prn albuterol

#HTN: Intially, held antihypertensive in patient with right 
heart strain as she is preload dependent.

#Depression
Continue home meds (abilify)

#Seizure Disorder
Unclear etiology, outpt notes suggest that it is ___ sarcoidosis
-Continued home vimpat, gabapentin 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
------------------
-patient came in on 15 mg prednisone for sarcoid. Unclear how 
long she has been on this dose and if necessary. Would recommend 
taper in future. Consider calcium, vitamin D as an outpatient 
for bone health
- Hyperglycemia continues to be issue and patient's insulin 
regimen may need to be further changed.
- If patient continues on steroids, needs to be started on 
bactrim ppx
- Patient had leukopenia during admission with no signs of 
infection, please trend CBC
- Patient with RBCs in urine, should be worked up as oupatient
- Patient had elevated LFTs, her simvastatin was stopped. She 
should have labs rechecked and RUQ and further lab testing 
should be performed if she does not improve

ultrasound on admission did not show evidence of cholecystitis. 
During the hospitalization, she had a max temperature of 100.3. 
After this peak in temperature, the patient did not have any 
more temperature spikes. During the hospitalization, the patient 
noticed her symptoms of facial congestion improved. Her symptoms 
were thought to be due to a viral illness and antibiotics were 
discontinued. Blood and urine cultures and nasopharyngeal swab 
were collected and followed during the admission. Urine culture 
had no growth; blood cultures were still pending. Nasopharyngeal 
swab was negative. The patient was discharged home without 
antibiotics.   
.
#NSCLC stage IV EGFR wild type: Treating with palliative intent. 
The patient last received a cycle of chemotherapy ___ 
(Docetaxel) with Neulasta support on day 2. The patient's folic 
acid was discontinued during this hospitalization. She met with 
palliative care to discuss symptom management and goals of care.

not interested in more chemotherapy. During her discussion with 
palliative care, the patient acknowledged that her mood is low, 
but feels that she is just being honest with her situation. The 
patient's primary oncology team was made aware of the patient's 
decision and was fully on board with the patient's decision. She 
is being discharged home on hospice. During this 
hospitalization, the patient was started on Morphine SR 30mg 
every 12 hours for pain control. The patient was tolerating this 
medication well prior to discharge. 
.
#Metastatic brain lesions: Patient is status post whole brain 
radiation therapy. Ther was no indication for acute steroids 
during this admission.
.
#Leukocytosis - The patient leukocytosis was thought to be 
attributed to infection as with clinical improvement of the 
patient's symptoms, her white count was trended downward. 
.
#Nausea - Patient had Zofran available to her during the 
admission. Per palliative care recs, the patient was transition 
to three times daily dosing of Reglan with instructions to stop 
taking Compazine as the side effect profile of these two 
medications is similar. 
.
#Constipation - The patient was continued on scheduled senna and 
colace; she had lactulose available to her as needed for 
constipation. The patient did have a bowel movement prior to 
discharge. 
.
#Anemia - The patient did not require any blood transfusions 
during this admission.
.
#Hyponatremia - This has been a chronic issue for the patient 
with a likely component of SIADH given the patient's known 
history of brain metastasis.
.
#Transaminitis - Unclear etiology. Transaminitis was trended and 
the patient's AST was noted to be trending downward on day of 
discharge.  
.
#Adjustment disorder with depressed features secondary to 
general medical condition: The patient had ativan available as 
needed. No other medications were started for this during this 
hospitalization. 
.
#Transition of Care:
- Focus of the patient's care will now focus on comfort given 
her decision to be discharged home to home hospice. 
- Follow-up of pending blood cultures.

IMAGING;
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) Study Date of ___ 9:23 AM 
COMPARISON: Compared to ultrasound from ___ and 
MRI from ___. FINDINGS: The liver remains coarse 
and heterogeneous, consistent with known cirrhosis. The cystic 
and solid lesion within segment IV is similar in comparison to 
the prior study and now measures 3.6 x 4.3 x 4.2 cm. Echogenic 
lesion within segment III is similar in appearance, and now 
measures 4.6 x 3.4 x 2.6 cm. These lesions were previously seen 
on MRI from ___, and correspond to areas of prior 
RFA treatment. There is an unchanged small calcification within 
the right lower lobe of the liver. There are numerous gallstones 
layering dependently within the gallbladder, with no evidence of 
cholecystitis. There is no gallbladder wall edema. The common 
bile duct measures 7 mm in diameter. There is no intrahepatic 
bile duct dilatation. There is a moderate amount of ascites, 
unchanged. The spleen is of normal size, measuring 11.6 cm. 
Doppler examination demonstrates patency of the main, right and 
left portal veins. Within the left portal vein, again 
arterialized waveform is demonstrated, which may reflect known 
arteriovenous fistula which was demonstrated on MRI of ___. The hepatic arteries are patent and demonstrate normal 
flow. Mark for paracentesis in the LLQ was placed by Dr. ___ 
___. IMPRESSION: 1. Cirrhosis, focal liver lesion consistent 
with s/p RFA treatment. 2. Moderate ascites. 3. Cholelithiasis. 
4. Patent main, right and left veins. Abnormal waveform of the 
left portal vein which suggests an arteriovenous fistula 
identified on MRI of ___. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of HTN, DM2, HCV cirrhosis c/b HCC (dx in 
___ and ? SBP (___), who presented with AMS. Was found to 
have SBP an and was treated with antibiotics as well as 
lactulose and rifaximin. He improved clinically and was 
discharged with close follow up. 
.  
# Hepatic encephalopathy: In setting of medication noncompliance 
and SBP. Poor social supports. CXR with ? retrocardiac opacity 
per ED read, but no fever, cough, leukocytosis. Received 
ceftriaxone and azithromycin x1 in ED. This covered for SBP as 
well. Diagnostic para after ABx was positive with >200PMN. 
Culture is pending but is unlikely to be positive now that 
already received antibiotics. UCx negative to date. BCx negative 
to date. ParaCx negative to date. Para fluid consistent with 
SBP. Treated as below. Continue Rifaximin 400 mg PO TID and 
Lactulose 30 mL PO TID.
.  
# Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Pt received azithromycin 
and ceftriaxone in the ED but did not have a diagnostic 
parecentesis. Diagnostic para the following day was positive for 
SBP with >200PMN per uL and 1500WBC/uL. Received ceftriaxone 1g 
IV daily for 3 days (___). Received 125g albumin IV x1 
(1.5g/kg) on ___ and an additional 75g (1g/kg) on ___ 
per protocol. Discharged on Cefpodoxime Proxetil 200 mg PO Q24H 
for 4 days to complete treatment of SBP.  
.  
# ESLD ___ HCV cirrhosis + HCC s/p RFA in ___: HCV s/p failed 
Ribavarin and interferon treatments. Has known grade I/II 
varices. Not a transplant candidate due to non-compliance and 
inadequate social supports. Continue rifaximin + lactulose for 
hepatic encephalopathy. Continue Nadolol 40 mg PO DAILY for 
varices. Discontinue ciprofloxacin 750 mg PO weekly and treat 
with ceftriaxone and cefpodoxime as above. Will DC on 
ciprofloxacin 250mg PO daily for SBP PPx.  
.  
# Acute on chronic kidney failure: Admitted with acute on 
chronic renal failure last admission (baseline had been 1.7, 
admitted at 5.6, discharged at 4.7, re-admitted at 4.0). CKD was 
felt to be likely due to DM and HTN, unclear why recent decline. 
Discontinued diuretics for the moment for renal failure. ___ 
restart as an outpatient. 
.  
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Down trending HCT this admission 
likely due to a combination of phlebotomy and poor production of 
RBC from renal failure. Guaiac negative. Iron studies are 
essentially WNL with depressed retic count consisdent with 
anemia of renal insufficiency. 
.  
# DM2: Continue insulin regimen (Lantus 60 + HISS)

Pertinent Results:
Cath report: ___
Coronary Anatomy
Dominance: Right
LMCA: The LMCA was long with mild ostial plaquing.
LAD: The mildly calcified proximal LAD tapered gradually to an 
80% stenosis with TIMI 2 pulsatile flow
beyond. The mid-distal LAD was very straight, but did not appear 
on a pseudo-lateral view to be intramyocardial. D1 had mild 
proximal disease. D2 was another large branch. LCX: The CX gave 
off a patent very high OM1 (functionally a ramus intermedius 
branch). The proximal
and mid AV groove CX had mild plaquing to 20%. The terminal 
segments of all the OMs were tortuous, suggestive of 
hypertensive heart disease. OM2 was small and OM3 was of modest 
caliber. OM4/LPL had a hairpin turn prior to its terminal 
tortuosity. The distal CX provided collaterals to a bifurcation 
that was likely the distal AV groove RCA and a RPL2. Flow in the 
OMs was pulsatile, consistent with microvascular dysfunction.
RCA: The RCA gave off a very early RV branch arising from a 
slightly angulated segment. The RPDA appeared to be stump 
occluded with filling of the apical segment via the high early 
RV branch. RPL1 appeared to be a branching vessel with its first 
two bifurcating sidebranches running laterally and the main pole 
running parallel to the absent RPDA. The distal AV groove RCA 
beyond this RPL appeared to be occluded, filling via 
left-to-right collaterals.
Intra-procedural Complications: None
Impressions:
1. Severe proximal LAD and likely totally occluded distal RCA 
disease (terminal AV groove RCA and
RPDA proper) in a young woman with poorly controlled diabetes 
mellitus.
2. Normal left ventricular diastolic pressures.

ECHO ___
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and 
regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 68 %). The 
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar.

pain on opiates and EtOH abuse who presented with intermittent 
hypotension requiring intermittent pressor support, likely 
related to medication side effect in combination with alcohol 
vs. underlying autonomic dysfunction. 

MICU Course: ___
Patient was admitted to the MICU for hypotension that required 
pressers. He was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics 
(Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Azithromycin). He was a taken off 
pressers immediately after coming to the MICU and was stable. 
After taking his medications in the morning he did drop his 
blood pressures and was ultimately needed fluid bolus and the 
restarting of pressers. Pressors were again switched off and he 
remained stable. He was called out and discharged to the floor 
on ___. At this time we believe his hypotensive episodes are 
more likely autonomic/neurologic or medication related or 
cardiac and unlikely related to infection.

Upon transfer to the medical floor on ___, chronic pain service 
reviewed patient's home regimen, and suggested patient resume 
his home pain medications. Patient was monitored on this 
regimen, and remained stable hemodynamically.

# Hypotension: 
Intermittent hypotension most likely related to medication side 
effect vs. autonomic dysfunction in the setting of HIV 
infection. No infectious symptoms, though treated for UTI given 
E. coli becteruria. Patient completed a 3 day course of 
ceftriaxone for UTI. Patient was initially treated for possible 
CAP with ctx/azithro, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR, 
and CAP course was abbreviated. Endocrine workup negative for 
adrenal insufficiency. Patient is on multiple medications that 
can contribute to somnolence, including opioids, 
benzodiazepines, and tizanidine, but none should cause 
hypotension. Autonomic neuropathy is common in HIV, and occurs 
more commonly with increasing burden of disease. Patient was 
arranged with neurology follow-up to address possible autonomic 
dysfunction.

# Chronic pain/opioid use:
Upon admission, many of home pain medications were held out of 
concern for contribution to hypotension. He was treated with 
oxycodone while holding home medications, which did not provide 
adequate analgesia. Spoke with chronic pain, who noted that home 
opioids, tizanidine, and lyrica can all be sedating, though 
unlikely to cause hypotension. Patient was resumed on home 
regimen without new prescriptions. Upon review of records, PCP 
was reluctant to continue to prescribe opioids going forward, 
given concurrent alcohol use. Patient was encouraged to abstain 
from alcohol, and expressed understanding. He has follow-up 
arranged with PCP as well as chronic pain clinic next week. 

# Alcohol use: 
Last drink AM ___. No history of withdrawal seizures. Patient 
was monitored on CIWA scale, and was continue on home clonazepam 
for anxiety.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
# HIV: continued Triumeq (abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivud) 
600-50-300 mg oral daily
# Chronic constipation/diarrhea: continued miralax, bisacodyl, 
senna 
# HTN: Held home lisinopril and Lasix 
# Anxiety: Continue ClonazePAM 0.5 mg PO/NG TID:PRN 

=====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[ ] HELD: Lasix, lisinopril, and tamsulosin during admission(and 
DID NOT restart upon discharge given concern for hypotension. 
Consider resuming these medications cautiously as clinically

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ 
because you were having periods of very low blood pressure. We 
looked into many possible causes of your low blood pressure. One 
thing that may have contributed to your low blood pressure was 
an infection in your urine. We started you on treatment for this 
urinary infection. We also reviewed your pain medications, and 
ultimately resumed your home doses, but encourage you to stop 
drinking alcohol and follow up with your primary care doctor as 
well as your chronic pain clinic. 

Another possible cause of your low blood pressure is something 
called ""autonomic dysfunction."" This can occur in people with 
HIV, and it is caused by a problem with the nerves that control 
your blood vessels and your blood pressure. We are recommending 
that you see a neurologist for testing to further evaluate this. 


It was a pleasure caring for you,
Your ___ Care Team

STUDIES
============
ECG (___):  Sinus rhythm with ventricular bigeminy. Compared 
to the previous tracing of ___ the ventricular ectopy is 
new.

CXR (___):  IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process, 
moderate cardiomegaly.  

ECHO (___):  The left atrium is moderately dilated. The 
right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic 
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis 
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and 
transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ a 
bioprosthetic aortic valve is now present. It is functioning 
normally. There is slightly more mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonary artery pressures are slightly higher. Other findings 
are similar. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY STATEMENT:  Ms. ___ is an ___ year old female 
with ___ CAD (s/p 6 stents), HTN, paroxysmal afib on coumadin 
and dronedarone, and aortic stenosis s/p porcine AVR ___ who 
presents with an episode from lightheadedness who was found (per 
report) to be with symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension. Pt. 
was without any repeat episodes of bradycardia or hypotension. 
Her lisinopril was held given low-normal BPs. She was noted to 
be in nearly continuous APC bigeminy/trigeminy pattern. It was 
thought that pt. was possibly pre-load dependent, may have been 
mildly hypovolemic resulting in symptomatic lightheadedness. We 
attempted to start pt. on beta blockade with metoprolol, however 
she refused given prior tolerance issues. We also noted pt. to 
be with infrequent paroxysmal runs of multifocal atrial 
tachycardia. For this, we began the pt. on low dose diltiazem to 
possibly help both conditions. She was discharged home with a 
___ of Heart's monitor and close cardiology follow-up.

ACTIVE ISSUES
================

# Bigeminy/Trigeminy:  Pt. presented with lightheadedness.  
According to her home healthcare workers, pt. was bradycardia 
and hypotensive.  There were no available EKGs or strips 
documenting bradycardia.  Pt. with recent AVR on ___ with 
___.  Pt. had TTE on admission which revealed a well-seated AVR. 
 There was no evidence of bradycardia on telemtry on admission.  
Pt. was noted to be in a bigeminy pattern with periods of 
trigeminy possibly triggered by an APC.  Her lightheadedness was 
attributed to hypovolemia in the setting of ventricular 
bigeminy/trigeminy.  She remained asymptomatic on admission.  
Pt. refused metoprolol as she reports not tolerating medication 
well in the past.  As such, she was discharged on her home 
dronaderone and diltiazem to maintain sinus rhythm and reduce 
the frequency of bigeminy.  She also was sent with ___ of 
hearts monitor.    

#) Paroxysmal Multifocal atrial tachycardia:  Pt. noted to have 
infrequent runs of MAT.  This possibly was contributing to pt's 
symptoms.  As such, she was initiated on diltiazem.

#) Acute Kidney Injury:  Pt. presented with creatinine to 1.2 up 
from baseline 0.9.  Likely pre-renal azotemia in the setting of 
slight volume depletion.  Her orthostatics were negative.  
Creatinine returned to baseline.

#) Anemia:  Pt. noted to have a normocytic anemia since time of 
surgery.  Anemia work-up with iron was unrevealing.  Would 
continue  Possibly related to anemia of acute/sub-acute blood 
loss. 
- anemia work-up
- retic count

Normocytic anemia since time of surgery.  Possibly related to 
anemia of acute/sub-acute blood loss.  Anemia work-up revealed 
normal iron studies, normal B12 and folate levels.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==================
#) Atrial Fibrillation:  Stable in sinus rhythm.  Continued on 
dronaderone.  Warfarin held in the setting of supratherapeutic 
INR on day of discharge.  

#) Dyslipidemia: Continued atorvastatin

#) Coronary Artery Disease:  Continued aspirin, atorvastatin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
# New Medications: Pt. started on diltiazem ER to possibly help 
with control of both MAT and ventricular bigeminy. 

# Lisinopril held on admission for low normal BPs in the setting 
of lightheadedness. If BP tolerate, can resume. However, her 
lightheadedness may be related to hypotension.

# Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Pt. noted to have brief 
asymptomatic runs of multifocal atrial tachycardia. Given not 
related to symptoms, unlikely cause of her presentation.

# Question of Bradycardia: Pt. sent to ___ for eval of 
symptomatic bradycardia. Not witnessed on hospitalization. 
Discharged with ___ to be sent to Dr. ___.

# Bigeminy/Trigeminy triggered by APCs: ___ result in pre-load 
dependent state resulting in lightheadedness. Pt. recommended 
metoprolol but not started on admission bc/ pt. refused ___ 
previous side effects. Consider beta blockade as outpatient to 
decrease occurrence of bigemeny.

# Anemia: Pt. with normocytic anemia. Vit B12 550 (nl), folate > 
than assay, ferritin 41, transferrin 266, TIBC 346 (all normal). 
Possibly related to recent surgery. Recommend outpt. follow-up 
in ___ weeks. 

# INR: Please do not take coumadin on ___ or ___. Have INR 
checked on ___ and dose per your normal ___ clinic.

# Communication: ___ (son) ___ 

# Code: Full code (confirmed)

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure meeting and caring for you during your 
hospitalization.  You were admitted with lightheadedness and 
slow heart rate.  The slow heart rate was suspected by your home 
physical therapist.  We did not see evidence of a slow heart 
rate during your hospital stay.  We felt that your symptoms were 
related to dehydration and an ongoing abnormal heart rhythm 
called ""ventricular bigeminy.""  This is not a dangerous rhythm.  
You were also noted to have short periods of a fast abnormal 
heart rhythm.  You were started on a medication, diltiazem, to 
help your abnormal heart beat conditions.  In case your 
lisinopril was making your blood pressure too low, we stopped 
this medication at this time.  

You were given ___ of Heart's Monitor at discharge.  Please 
remember that when you are feeling strange, please be sure to 
transmit information from the monitor to Dr. ___.  You will be 
seen by Dr. ___ to continue to manage your heart medications.

All the best,

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ Year old male with history of celiac disease,
psoriasis, and HTN who presented to the ED with multiple painful
& erythematous cutaneous lesions that began on ___. He
also had a severe sore throat as well as a cough. His other pain
complaint is profound lower extremity weakness which has 
resulted
in a fall and him being afraid to walk. 

The patient reported the sudden onset of a red painful indurated
nodule on his extensor forearm two days prior to presentation.
Shortly thereafter he noted similar lesions developing on his
left arm, left knee and left ankle. He had no associated fevers
or chills. Of note, the patient has had no known exposures,
though he works as ___ and has been doing ___ in
debris filled buildings. No travel (including to any areas where
coccidiomyocosis or histoplasmosis is endemic). No antibiotics.
No new medications, detergents, soaps, etc. Monogamous with his
wife, no hx or risk factors for STIs including syphilis, HIV, 
GC,
or chlamydia. The patient does have a dog (has had for ___ years)
and denies any recent bites or scratches. No exposures to birds,
cattle, cats, rabbits or other wildlife. 

He states that this rash has also been associated with a sore
throat and cough that developed over this time period. The cough
is non-productive, but he reports that it feels ""very deep"" and
that he has been more short of breath over the past week.

Additionally, on the morning of presentation, he reports that he
was so weak that his legs gave out from under him as he was
standing up. Since the initial fall, he has been ambulating
without assistance, but continues to report profound weakness 
and
is afraid to walk. He had a fall years ago where he ""fractured""
his spine and needed to have back surgery. Since then he has had
chronic pain which has been getting progressively worse over the
past 6 weeks. No new trauma to his back/legs. Denies bowel
incontinence, urinary retention or incontinence, or genital
numbness.

ED COURSE: 
In the ED his exam showed multiple palpable erythematous tender
and warm lesions on the extremities. The patient was also
tachycardic to 117 on presentation but otherwise without fevers
or signs of systemic illness. His lab work was notable for an
elevated CRP >100, WBC 11.4, and a lactate of 2.3, but was
otherwise unremarkable. UA was unremarkable. He had blood
cultures drawn. Dermatology was consulted and per conversation
with ED resident they were concerned about strep throat causing
erythema nodosum. They recommended biopsy (they will do), CTX,
and cultures. The patient received CTX, Ketorolac, 1L IVF.

On arrival to the floor, the patient confirms the above history.
Says his pain and the size of nodule swelling on his right arm
has improved after Toradol.

consistent with erythema nodosum, however, the presence of 
nodules on the arms was atypical. As a result, dermatology was 
consulted and performed a tissue biopsy, which showed findings 
consistent with erythema nodosum. Infectious workup was notable 
for negative hepatitis B serologies, negative HIV antibody, 
negative hepatitis C antibody, negative urine culture, negative 
Monospot, negative RPR, and unremarkable EBV serologies. Of 
note, Strep was pending at discharge a rheumatologic workup was 
also performed and was notable for a CRP of 100.3, borderline 
positive ___ (1: 40), negative ANCA. At the time of discharge, 
the patient's rash improved, and the pain from the rash was 
well-controlled with over-the-counter NSAIDs and acetaminophen. 
He was discharged with instructions to follow-up with 
dermatology pending formal tissue biopsy results.

# Sore throat
# Cough
The patient reported having about 2 weeks of sore throat 
associated with non-productive cough. Throughout his 
hospitalization, the patient had normal O2 saturations on room 
air. A chest x-ray performed in the emergency department did not 
show any evidence of pneumonia. On discharge, his sore throat 
was improved and his breathing remained at baseline. Etiology of 
the sore throat is most likely viral. Given that the sore throat 
preceded erythema nodosum, there was concern that the sore 
throat was caused by streptococcal pharyngitis. As a result, the 
patient received 2 g of ceftriaxone during his hospitalization. 
However, on ___, ceftriaxone was discontinued as it was 
determined that the patient had a very low risk of streptococcal 
pharyngitis given his age.

# Bilateral leg weakness
He has long-standing weakness that he reports is from previous 
back injuries. He was seen by physical therapy he felt that he 
was safe to go home without any more needs.

IMAGING: 
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 4:33 ___ COMPARISON: 
Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___. 
FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded and clear. The mediastinum 
is unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits 
for size. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The bones are 
diffusely osteopenic but otherwise unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No 
acute pulmonary process.
.
TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 11:55:56 AM The left atrium is 
normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot 
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. IMPRESSION: no echo evidence of vegetation or abscess. 
Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild symmetric LVH with normal 
regional and global biventricular function.If clinically 
suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography 
does not exclude endocarditis. Compared with the report of the 
prior study (images unavailable for review) of ___, the 
findings are similar.  
.
RENAL TRANSPLANT ___. Study Date of ___ 1:11 ___ FINDINGS: 
The left lower quadrant renal transplant measures 11.3 cm. No 
evidence of hydronephrosis, renal stones, or perinephric fluid. 
In the superior pole of the left lower quadrant transplant 
kidney, there is a prominent calix which is unchanged when 
compared to the prior study dated ___. Normal 
color and waveforms are seen in the interlobular renal arteries 
in the upper, mid and lower poles of the transplanted left lower 
quadrant kidney. The resistive indices are mildly elevated and 
range from 0.65-0.78. The main renal artery and main renal vein 
are patent with appropriate waveforms. The bladder is partially 
distended and is grossly unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No 
evidence of hydronephrosis, renal stones, or perinephric fluid 
collections. 2. Mildly elevated resistive indices (0.65-0.78) of 
the transplant kidney in the left lower quadrant. This finding 
is not significantly changed since the prior study dated 
___.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ s/p renal & pancreas transplants on ___, prednisone, 
and Prograf who presented to the ED with fevers, chills, and 
fatigue. She was recently treated for pyelonephritis but seems 
to have cleared that infection based on follow up culture. On 
admission she had a positive UA and a new systolic murmur. 
Initially there was concern for endocarditis but her fevers 
quickly resolved with antibiotics, a UCx was positive for the 
same strain of Ecoli as her recent UTI, and no blood cultures 
were positive. Once the hyperdynamic state of her acute 
infection resolved her cardiac murmur improved. A TTE was 
negative for vegetations. Ultimately it seems that the present 
illness is due to a recurrence of pyelonephritis. She was 
discharged on a prolonged course of Macrobid for a total of 
three weeks of treatment. 
.  
# Pyelonephritis: Likely source of fevers is pyelonephritis. A 
UA on admission showed ___, with UCx pending. BCx also 
pending. CXR showed no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process 
and the patient has no pulmonary symptoms at present. CBC showed 
no leukocytosis but elevated compared to baseline on tripple 
agent immune suppression. On acyclovir prophylactically. On 
physical exam she had no obvious localizing symptoms or 
tenderness over her kidney graft site. However, she was found to 
have a loud systolic murmur on exam not previously noted in OMR. 
The patient does state she has been told of a murmur in the 
past. Given this, the most likely source of fever is a 
UTI/pyelo. Nevertheless, she was also worked up for 
endocarditis. Of note, the Pt have multiple drug allergies which 
complicate antibiotic choice. Initial UA positive with ___. UCx 
grew Ecoli similar to her last UTI. BCx were negative. CXR with 
no evidence of PNA. TTE showed no evidence of vegetations. 
Intially she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics with 
aztreonam for Gram negatives, vancomycin for Gram positives, and 
metronidazole for anaerobes starting on ___. Once the UCx 
grew the same Ecoli as the previous infection she was DCed home 
on a 3 week course of Macrobid with close follow up. Will need 
urologic workup if infection recurs. 
.  
# Renal/Pancreatic transplant: Baseline Cr 1.3-1.5, but 
admission Cr 1.9. Improved with hydration and holding captopril. 
She was a baseline and back on captopril at discharge. Ulytes 
pre-renal. Continue PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY. Continue Sirolimus 
3 mg PO DAILY. Continue Tacrolimus 2 mg PO QAM and 1 mg PO QHS.

Pathology from ___ bronch with FNA and biopsy PENDING

IMAGING:
___ CT ABD/PELVIS FOR RE-STAGING: 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Multiple hepatic lesions have increased in size and number 
from the prior study consistent with worsening metastatic 
disease 
2. There has been interval progression of osseous metastases 
with a new lesion at T10 and an enlarged lesion involving T12. 
3. Right hilar/ infrahilar mass adjacent to the right heart 
border is only partially imaged but appears increased in size 
from the recent chest CT. 

___ CXR AFTER BRONCH AND STENT PLACEMENT:
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little 
overall change.  Again there is a large perihilar mass with 
extension along the right paratracheal region.  Continued 
elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with minimal 
atelectatic changes.  The left lung remains essentially clear. 

BRONCHOSCOPY REPORT: ___
Airways examined with flexible bronchoscope revealing 
moderate-severe compression of distal trachea and proximal LMSB 
and RMSB. RUL was completely occluded. Flexible bronchoscope 
removed and flexible scope with EBUS inserted and advanced to 
paratracheal mass where multiple TBNA were performed using 
21gauge and 18 gauge needles. Next proximal tracheal and distal 
RMSB borders of mass were marked using TBNA needle via EBUS 
scope. Finally a 16X13X13mm silicone Y stent was deployed with 
following ___ - tracheal limb = 4cm, LMSB limb = 2.5cm, 
RMSb limb = 3.5cm with RUL take off @ 2.5cm. Rigid scope removed 
and exchanged for ETT.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female, with h/o stage IV SCLC of neuroendocrine 
origin, known to be metastatic to liver and abdominal LN, s/p 6 
cycles of carboplatin/etoposide (last dose ___ who presented 
with dyspnea and cancer progression. 
 
# Dyspnea: Likely related to progression of her lung cancer, 
since it appears to be larger on ___ CT chest and partially 
obstructing the upper airways/trachea.  She underwent 
bronchoscopy on ___ and they placed a stent in her trachea 
to relieve the compression.  Re-staging CT abdomen/pelvis showed 
increased size and new liver mets and additional new mets in the 
vertebra as well.  Given the progression of her cancer, she was 
set up to start erlotinib with her local oncologist, Dr. ___.  
She was discharged with n-acetylcysteine nebulizers BID for 1 
week to help her secretions get out past the new stent.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital because of 
worsening shortness of breath.  Your labs and chest x-ray showed 
no evidence of infection.  Your last CT image showed progression 
of your lung mass and obstruction of your airway.  You were 
evaluated by the Interventional Pulmonary team who placed a 
stent in your airway and performed a biopsy.

You will be going home with inhaled mucomyst.  Please make sure 
to do each treatment for as long as you can and to take deep 
breaths in and out during each treatment.  We also started you 
on pain medications while in the hospital.  You should not take 
these medications if you feel sleepy, with alcohol, or when 
operating any machinery.  Because these pain medications can 
cause constipation, you will also need to continue stool 
softeners when you return home.

Please follow-up with your outpatient providers as instructed 
below.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.  All best 
wishes for your recovery.

Sincerely,
Your ___ medical team

1.  Patient with known history of metastatic rectal cancer, 
status post resection of a left cerebellar metastasis, nodular 
meningeal-based enhancing soft tissue in the resection bed 
consistent with recurrent tumor is unchanged since ___.
2.  Prepontine cisternal and upper cervical intradural enhancing 
lesions have slightly increased in size, compared to the prior 
study, with no new lesion.
.
___ CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:
1) Unchanged extracranial occipital soft tissue and pre-pontine 
cistern masses consistent with metastatic disease.
2) No evidence for new metastatic disease on this nonenhanced 
study.
.
___ MRI Head: IMPRESSION:  Motion-degraded study, 
particularly the post-contrast MP-RAGE sequence, with: 
1.  No acute intracranial abnormality; there is no evidence of 
acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. 
2.  Relatively unchanged appearance to the known intracranial 
metastatic disease, including in the left cerebellar hemispheric 
resection bed, with no new metastatic lesion identified. 
3.  Evidence of radiotherapy-related change. 
.  
___ C spine MRI w & w/o contrast: IMPRESSION:  Intradural 
extramedullary C2-C3 lesion along the posterior aspect of the 
spinal canal, causing mass effect and compressing the spinal 
cord, which appears anteriorly displaced.  Signal within the 
cord is difficult to evaluate due to significant motion. 
.
___ pCXR: Impression: The left Port-A-Cath catheter tip is 
at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Heart size and mediastinum 
are grossly unchanged.  Lungs are essentially well aerated with 
no evidence of consolidative process.  Surgical clips are 
projecting over the right hemithorax. 
.
___ x-ray C-spine: 
 
A single limited intraoperative fluoroscopic image of the 
lateral cervical 
spine is submitted for review.  Only the C2 and C3 vertebral 
bodies are imaged in their entirety.  A localizing device is 
present overlying the posterior elements at the C2-C3 level.  
For procedural details, please see the operative report.  

___ CXR:
FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip 
terminating 
approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  Small amount of 
pneumomediastinum is likely related to recent cervical spine 
surgery with extension of gas from the lower neck into the 
mediastinum.  The heart size is normal.  Within the lungs, a 
note is made of surgical clips in the right mid lung region as 
well as mild right-sided volume loss, likely postoperative.  
Right costophrenic sulcus is less well demonstrated and could 
reflect a small right pleural effusion.  The left lung and 
pleural surfaces are grossly clear. 

___ MRI C-SPINE W/WO CONTRAST: 
A single limited intraoperative fluoroscopic image of the 
lateral cervical spine is submitted for review.  Only the C2 and 
C3 vertebral bodies are imaged in their entirety.  A localizing 
device is present overlying the posterior elements at the C2-C3 
level.   

___ NON CONTRAST HEAD CT:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  New pneumocephalus, likely post-operative in the setting of 
recent 
cervical spine intradural tumor resection.   
  
2.  Prepontine cisternal and extracranial occipital soft tissue 
lesions, 
consistent with known metastatic disease.   

___ NON CONTRAST HEAD CT:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Decreased postsurgical pneumocephalus. 
2. No evidence of acute abnormalities. Grossly stable mild left 
cerebellar 
edema related to known metastases, and stable right prepontine 
mass. 
3. Unchanged mild diffuse ventriculomegaly.

left, and paresthesias in both fingers. Repeat brain MRI ___ 
this admission was negative for progression. On ___ the patient 
developed rapidly progressive RUE weakness and was started on 
empiric dexamethasone out of concern for cord compression. A C 
spine MRI confirmed  large C2-3 posterior epidural lesion with 
significant canal stenosis. On ___ had C2-C5 laminectomy with 
tumor decompression. On ___ patient had omaya placement for 
intrathecal chemotherapy. Patient subsequently started C1D1 of 
Cytarabine on ___.  ___ hospital course is summarized 
by problems below:

discharged home on steroid taper and continue cytarabine 
therapy.

# Posterior neck pain/headache with RUE weakness/RLE weakness 
and C2/C3 cord compression: Patient had worsened deterioration 
on ___ which was  worrisome for cord compression at level of C 
spine. MRI ___ shows cord compression C2/C3. RUE weakness 
worsened with new LUE pain and weakness over the next days 
despite steroids while a treatment plan was developed. Radiation 
oncology advised that THERE WAS NO ROLE FOR XRT. Surgical 
decompression remained the only option but was extremely high 
risk AND tumor was likely to recur rapidly. After full 
discussion of risks, patient proceeded with surgery on ___.

also complicated by stroke, deep vein thrombosis and need for a 
feeding tube. He had been recovering well over the last few 
weeks however on ___ morning (___) he developed a small, 
raised, fluid-filled pocket towards mid portion of his incision 
just above the prior infection site. His temperature orally at 
the
time was 99.7F. He denies any current fever/chills but does note 
pain over the area, dyspnea and fatigue. He reports no trauma to 
the area over the last few days. He also notes that his former

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was seen in clinic and admitted for sternal 
debridement. On ___ he underwent sternal debridement and 
during the procedure the LIMA was transected. The sternum was 
left open and the patient went immediately to the cath lab from 
the OR.  He was found to have native LAD disease but he was not 
stented because he was going to need further OR procedures, 
including pectoralis flaps, and it would have been problematic 
to have the pt. on Plavix.
His was treated with Vanco/Meropenem/Micafungin and Tobramycin. 
He went for a sternal washout on ___ and required some PRBC 
after the procedure. On ___ he was having ventricular 
arrhythmias which were treated with Lido and Amiodorone.  He was 
progressively acidotic over the day and had a rising lactate. He 
was seen by EP and the interventional cardiologists.  ___ he 
required a bicarb gtt and his lactate was rising despite volume. 
He underwent an exploratory laparotomy which was negative. When 
he was being moved from the OR table to the bed he coded and was 
shocked and had ROSC. He was then taken to the cath lab and had 
a stent placed to the LAD.  He again became unstable in the cath 
lab and had VT which resolved with epi.
He was transferred back to the CVICU and continued to 
deteriorate. He required increased pressors and went up to 0.6 
of levo, 0.2 of epi, and was also on maximum doses of 
vasopressin and neo.  
His family was present for most of the day and Dr. ___ them 
fully informed. He remained on multiple drips and CRRT was 
started.  He did not improve and since the cath lab his pupils 
were fixed and dilated.
He became asystolic at 3:35 on ___ and had no blood pressure. 
The family and Dr. ___ informed of the patient's demise. 
The family did not want an autopsy and the medical examiner 
declined the case.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr ___,

It was a pleasure participating in your care while you were 
admitted to ___. As you know 
you were admitted because you were experiencing abdominal pain 
and were ultimately found to have pancreatitis. This was caused 
by drinking too much alcohol and it is very important that you 
decrease the amount you are drinking.  Your blood sugars were 
also extremely high and you develop a condition called Diabetic 
Ketoacidosis. This can be extremely dangerous and it is very 
important that you take insulin as instructed.

#Testicular pain/swelling
Admitted overnight on ___ with complaints of marked scrotal 
tenderness and erythema. Patient was afebrile with stable vital 
signs. His exam showed erythema over scrotal skin as well as 
erythematous skin within his groin folds bilaterally. WBC was 
11.1. There was concern for a deeper perineal infection, so 
General Surgery and Urology were consulted. Based on these 
services' recommendations, the patient was initially started on 
empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, zosyn, & 
clindamycin. However, a CT pelvis showed no signs of necrotizing 
fascitis, and with low suspicion for fournier's gangrene, the 
zosyn and clindamycin were discontinued. He received a 1 time 
dose of 2mg IV morphine for pain control, but by the following 
morning, was no longer having any pain or tenderness to 
palpation. Further, his WBC count had normalized. He was felt to 
have a topical fungal infection with possibly an associated 
cellulitis. Given the clinical improvement, we discharged the 
patient home on PO bactrim DS BID 7-day course and miconazole 
cream bid. Patient was encouraged to maintain good perineal 
hygiene and to take tylenol for potential perineal discomfort. 
Blood and urine cultures are negative to date. He will f/u in

___ CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECO - No CT evidence of acute 
intracranial process. Aerosolized secretion in the left 
sphenoidal sinus suggest sinusitis. Futher details to be 
provided with CTA report. CTA: No evidence of dissection, 
aneurysm, vascular malformation or flow-limiting stenosis. Intra 
and extracranial anterior and posterior circulation arteries are 
patent. Left cavernous carotid is slightly smaller than right. 
Mild degenerative changes with disc space narrowing and 
disc-osteophyte complexes at C4/5, ___, and ___. No significant 
spinal canal 
narrowing. Awaiting 3D reformations. 
.
___ MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No evidence of acute infarction. 
Fluid in the sphenoid sinus with aerosolized secretions 
consistent with acute sinusitis.
.
___ CHEST (PA & LAT) - No acute findings. No mediastinal 
widening.
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION: ___ with a PMH significant for ulcerative colitis 
and remote history of migraine headache who presented with 
headache and transient vision changes found to be hypertensive 
to 200/100 mmHg with reassuring CTA head and neck imaging 
concerning for hypertensive urgency vs. emergency.
.
# HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY VS. EMERGENCY - The patient presented 
with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg on routine PCP ___ 
1-month ago with no prior history of hypertension, certainly a 
prior history of uncontrolled essential hypertension is 
plausible. She has few modifiable risk factors, she is not 
obese, denies excessive alcohol intake, and is physically active 
with aerobic activity. She is not on anti-hypertensive 
medications and recently discontinued her OCP (Aviane). Her 
blood pressure has ranged from ___ mmHg over 2-days 
with symptoms of posterior headache and neck pain, involuntary 
muscle spasm vs. distal extremity parathesias and twitching as 
well as transient vision concerns - despite normal renal 
function, no cardiac ischemic changes on EKG, encephalopathy, 
papilledema or retinal hemorrhaging. Given this symptomatology, 
hypertensive emergency was the concern. Overall her work-up was 
reassuring with a negative head and neck CTA and negative head 
MR imaging. She also had a reasurring laboratory work-up, 
although her EKG did show some chronic LVH changes and 
ultimately we attributed her condition to undiagnosed and 
uncontrolled essential hypertension. A Labetalol gtt was started 
in the ED and she was quickly weaned to PO Labetalol and then 
started Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily which will continue as an 
outpatient. She will follow-up with her PCP ___ 1-week for 
electrolyte monitoring.
.
# NECK SPASM, CERVICAL DYSTONIA - The patient presented with 
features of right neck and shoulder pain that has occurred 
before, per her daughter. The physical exam findings and 
clinical history indicate a primary focal dystonia or cervical 
dystonia. Half of patients describe pain in the setting of these 
findings. Her CTA did note some degenerative changes with disc 
space narrowing and disc-osteophyte complexes at C4/5, ___, and 
___ but the symptomatology seemed unrelated. This likely 
represents a separate process from her hypertensive urgency and 
there is no evidence of a medication-induced effect. She 
responded to Tylenol and PRN Valium with symptomatic relief.
.
# ULCERATIVE COLITIS - History of ulcerative colitis that has 
been left-colon predominant diagnosed in ___. She has had prior 
flares a few times yearly with rectal bleeding and last 
sigmoidoscopy in ___ showed left-sided colitis only. She has 
never been on corticosteroid treatment. She was previously on 
5-ASA (Rewasa) therapy only intermittently. She has no active 
rectal bleeding or abdominal pain symptoms to suggest active 
flare.
.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with h/o psoriatic arthritis 
and spondylitis involving his neck/back who presents with 
headache. Notes headache came on ___ afternoon at which point

same as multiple prior episodes that occur when his disease 
flares, usually when he is on less immunosuppression. He has 
been treated with remicade, enbrel, and orencia in the past but 
either had side effects or found the medication to be unhelpful 
after a time. He reports no fevers or neck stiffness and no 
photophobia. He is now on imuran 100 mg bid and prednisone 50 mg 
daily (has been on prednisone for over one year per report). On 
___, he tried morphine SR 60 mg twice (AM & ___ and 
morphine ___ 15 mg X 2 but did not have relief of pain; he 
contacted the rheumatology attending on call at that point who 
advised ED evaluation. He denies any visual changes, nausea, or 
vomiting. Pain started in occipital region yesterday but now 
generalized over entire head (his usual pattern). He denies any 
slurred speech, seizures, syncope, or numbness in either arm or 
leg. He reports chronic weakness in the right hand.  
.  
He has also noted increased swelling in his hands and feet, 
which also happens when his immunosuppression is lowered. He is 
awaiting approval for humira but this has not yet been done. He

In the ED, initial vitals T 98.8, HR 85, BP 144/63, RR 18, 99% 
on RA. He was treatd with morphine 4 mg IV X 2 for pain relief 
with good result. He also received 125 mg IV solumedrol due to 
concern for worsening joint disease. He also received humalog 19 
U SC X 1 and azathioprine 100 mg PO X 1. Labs were remarkable 
for lactate 2.7.  
.  
Of note, the patient was last admitted ___ for 
headache. His headache was attributed in the past to his 
cervical spine psoriatic arthritis, which was initially treated 
with Botox injections by Dr. ___ in the pain clinic, but

Remicade, which he has developed an allergy to. Last admission 
the patient was treated initially with IV narcotics and then 
discharged with PO morphine SR and ___ as needed for pain, and 
scheduled for pain consult as an outpatient for consideration of 
Botox injections. In the interim, he did not need the morphine 
___ or SR per his report (until ___. The patient also had a

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old male with history of psoriatic 
arthritis and IBD presenting with exacerbation of cervicogenic 
headache.  
.  
#. Cervicogenic headache, acute on chronic: Patient has a 
history of these headaches which he describes as chronic daily 
headaches, from bilateral occipital region
radiating to temporal and frontal areas, lasting from hours to 
days, with some visual blurring, without mitigating factors. He 
has a history of positive tenderness on pressure over the 
greater occipital nerve region as well as over the temporal 
region. Patient was diagnosed with cerviogenic headache and 
myofascial pain, with question of his psoriatic arthritis 
affecting his cervical spine as part of
the etiology. Patient reports this headache has the same 
characteristics of prior headaches and unfortunately, he has as 
yet been unable to obtain humeria on an outpatient basis. No 
meningismus, fever or altered mental status to suggest 
infection. Left shift from chronic steroids. No mechanical 
trauma or point tenderness. Patient transitioned from IV 
morphine back to ___ morphine + Ms ___. Given solumedrol x1 IV 
in ED, prednisone 50mg PO on the floor. Patient was seen by 
rheumatology who felt that increasing the steroids would not be 
an effective intervention. Patient was evaluated by pain service 
and an occipital nerve block was done. Bilateral GONB and TPI to 
Bilateral splenius capitis and occipitalis with 14 cc 0.25% 
bupivicaine PF and 10 mg MPA without complications 
.  
#. PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS: The patient has disease which seems to 
worsen on his current regimen of imuran and prednisone. Awaiting 
humira as above and this appears to have been quite a 
complicated process unfortunately. Currently somewhat 
symptomatic with some joint pain and swollen hands and knees. 
Rheumatology felt that the headache exacerbation was not related 
to the arthitis. They did not recommend any change in 
management. Continue Ca, VitD, and Bactrim as PPx against AEs 
from steroids  
should have PCP ppx with ___ SS daily. Continue home regimen 
of azathioprine 100mg PO BID.
.  
#. DIABETES: Hold glyburide for now. Continue outpatient 
glargine 50 units QAM plus 30 U QHS, fingersticks four times 
daily.
.  
# Axillary cyst: Continue augmentin 875 mg bid for 7d ending 
___
.
# Peripheral neuropathy but no new neuro symptoms  
.
#. HTN: Continue home regimen with HCTZ, Toprol XL and 
lisinopril.  
.  
#. HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Continue home regimen of pravastatin.  
.  
# s/p submandibular sialoadenitis- completed clida course

Date of ___ 12:08 ___ 

HISTORY: ___ male who had presented to outside hospital 
with right 
leg pain after travel from ___, with extensive right 
lower extremity 
DVT in thigh and calf by outside hospital ultrasound yesterday. 
Here to 
assess extent of DVT in the IVC and lower extremity prior to 
possible 
thrombectomy. 
  
COMPARISON: None available. 
  
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial imaging was performed through the abdomen, 
pelvis and 
bilateral lower extremities including the Inferior Vena Cava to 
the veins of 
the ankles after administration of 150 mL of IV Optiray 350. 
Multiplanar 
reformatted images were then obtained. 
  
CTV ABDOMEN: Dependent atelectatic changes are noted in the lung 
bases.  
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The liver, 
gallbladder, 
pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys and ureters are unremarkable. 
The spleen is 
enlarged, measuring 14.6 cm, without focal lesion. The 
non-opacified stomach, 
small bowel, colon, and appendix appear unremarkable. No free 
air, free fluid 
or adenopathy is noted by size criteria. The abdominal aorta is 
of normal 
caliber. No filling defect is seen in the splenic, superior 
mesenteric, or 
portal veins. Also no filling defect is seen in the IVC to 
suggest thrombus. 
  
CTV PELVIS: The urinary bladder and the distal ureters are 
unremarkable. The 
prostate is not enlarged. Note is made of a 9-mm utricle cyst in 
the midline 
prostate. Additionally, there is 1.3 x 2.5 cm left seminal 
vesicle cyst.  
Trace fluid is noted in the pelvis (2:141), of indeterminate 
significance.  
Non-opacified pelvic loops of bowel and rectosigmoid colon are 
unremarkable.  
There is no free air or adenopathy within the pelvis. The lower 
IVC and 
bilateral common, internal, and external veins are patent, with 
no filling 
defect to suggest thrombosis. 
  
CTV BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITIES: There is nearly occlusive 
thrombus seen in 
the right superficial femoral vein, which is expanded and has 
surrounding 
stranding consistent with acute thrombosis. The superior extent 
of the 
thrombus is seen in the right common femoral vein, extending 
just above the 
confluence with the greater saphenous vein. Thrombus extends 
contiguously 
into the popliteal vein and into the proximal anterior tibial, 
posterior 
tibial and peroneal veins. Nonvisualization of these veins more 
distally in 
the calf, when compared with the normal left side, is consistent 
with 
thrombosis. The right deep femoral vein and the greater 
saphenous vein are 
patent. There is no evidence of left lower extremity deep venous 
thrombosis.  
Note is made of tiny right ___ cyst (2:337). 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No region of bony destruction or acute 
fracture is seen 
in the visualized osseous structures. Degenerative endplate 
changes are noted 
along the visualized thoracolumbar spine, without 
spondylolisthesis. Lucent 
lesion with surrounding sclerosis along the inferior iliac 
aspect of the right 
sacroiliac joint may represent degenerative change (2:141). 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Acute right lower extremity DVT extends from the right common 
femoral vein 
through the superficial femoral vein, popliteal vein and through 
the right 
calf veins.  
  
2. Tiny right ___ cyst. 
  
3. Splenomegaly. 
  
4. Trace pelvic fluid, of indeterminate etiology. 
  
5. Incidentally noted utricle cyst and left seminal vesicle 
cyst. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was admitted to the vascular surgery team on ___.  
He was started on a therapeutic heparin drip and a ___ stocking 
placed on his right leg with right lower extremity elevation.  A 
CT-V was obtained upon admission. This showed an acute right 
lower extremity DVT extending from the right common femoral vein 
through the superficial femoral vein, popliteal vein and through 
the right calf veins.  The heparin gtt was continued and 
coumadin therapy initiated.  Mr. ___ did well and remained 
stable throughout his hospital course. On ___ his right lower 
extremity had no swelling and minimal tenderness.  Given the 
location of the dvt, and the patients physical exam, Dr. ___ 
___ that operative thrombolysis was not neccessary.  Mr. 
___ was transitioned from a heparin gtt to therapeutic 
lovenox injections and continued on coumadin. He was out of bed, 
ambulating short distances in his room. He did have quite a bit 
of pain with ambulation, but said oxycodone was helping.  He was 
discharged on ___ once ambulating independently and adequate

Brief Hospital Course:
Legal: ___
Psychiatric:
Patient presented in disorganized state, exhibiting symptoms of 
pressured speech, tangential behavior, elevated mood, SIB 
(slapped self), and hypersexuality. Patient also had notable 
cognitive deficits, particularly in memory (note patient has 
already had formal Neuro-Psych testing in ___ which showed 
gross executive functional impairment of unknown etiology). 
Patient evaluated medically in the unit for other underlying 
organic causes (see below), but no significant organic 
explanation of symptoms. 

Upon admission medications were: Clonezepam 0.5 mg QHS, 
Lamotrigine 200 mg PO QHS, Trazodone 75 mg PO HS, Venlafaxine 
150 mg PO daily, Zolpidem tartrate 10 mg PO HS. We continued 
Lamotrigine 200 mg PO QHS, discontinued the trazadone and 
zolpidem tartarate and discontinued venlafaxine via a gradual 
taper. We initiated and tapered quietapine up to 150 mg QHS and 
held steady at this dose. We initially tapered and discontinued 
Clonezepam but due to patient report nightly panic attacks we 
restarted Clonezepam 0.5 mg QHS, with good effect and subsequent 
dramatic improvement in sleep.

With medication adjustments and individual, group, and milieu 
therapy, the patient slowly and steadily improved. With a 
significant improvement in her degree of mood lability, 
organization, and degree of disinhibition. Her insight into her 
condition and judgement also significantly improved. Her panic 
attacks resolved and her sleep also greatly improved.  At no 
point during her hospitalization did she demonstrate suicidal 
thoughts or self injury. She was always cooperative and help 
seeking. 

By the time of discharge the patient's acute mania resolved and 
appeared close to her baseline. She participated appropriately 
with her peers and in groups.  She is able to dress herself, 
groom, and take regular showers. Her gait has improved 
dramatically, at times needed reminders to use her cane early on 
in admission. By time of discharge, she demonstrated good safety 
awareness and care when changing positions. She was not 
orthostatic by frequent vital sign checks. The patient exhibited 
no self-injurious behavior while hospitalized nor did she voice 
any intent to harm herself during this hospitalization. Ms. 
___ is stable to go home to a supervised environment that 
___ can provide in addition to structure provided by a 
day treatment program. She will continue to have regular follow 
up by her outpatient providers.       
 
Medical:
#) Neurological workup: CT Head ordered by team showed enlarged 
ventricles and evidence of hypodensities indicating some small 
vessel ischemic disease but no gross abnormality. Patient had 
laboratories (CBC, electrolytes) which were within normal 
limits. UA showed +WBC but no nitrates.

#) Nutrition/Weight Loss: Nutrition consult revealed patient is 
low nutrition risk. Diet supplemented with ensure in unit. 
Patient to follow up with PCP for further evaluation for medical 
causes of weight loss. Patient ate all of her meals during her 
hospitalization without difficulty. 

#) Hair loss: Patient reported hair loss over the past ~6 
months. Initial ___ including CBC, BMP, TSH, B12, Folate was 
negative for a revealing etiology. The patient showed no 
evidence of self inflicted hair loss during hospitalization. 
Patient instructed to follow-up with her PCP for further ___ 
of her hair loss. 

#) Fall risk: ___ assessment determined patient is a low fall 
risk but encouraged patient to use cane at all times for safety. 
Patient was able to follow these recommendations well by the end 
of her hospitalization 

#) Orthostasis: Patient initially experienced orthostasis early 
on during hospitalization when her seroquel was being titrated, 
this resolved and she tolerated 150mg seroquel well by time of 
dischagre. . 

#) Sacral Folliculitis: Evaluated by wound nurse in hospital. 
Dressing placed. Per wound nurse evaluation, does not appear to 
be related to picking behavior or prolonged sitting. The patient 
remained appropriately mobile and active through out 
hospitaization. Patient to follow-up with PCP.

#) Borderline UA: Urine culture was likely contaminated but 
positive for gardinella. Patient denied any symptoms of vaginal 
discharge or pain. No symptoms of dysuria. As a result, there 
was no further follow-up or treatment.

Family/Social Work: Patient lives at a ___, a facility 
without nighttime care but nursing and staff throughout the day. 
She also enjoys attending a geriatric day program. Her care was 
coordinated with her children by socialwork and the patient 
remained in frequent contact with them through out her stay. 
___ house was also coordinated with at time of discharge. 
Initally requesting transfer to rehab, but ultimately accepting 
her transfer back to them. 

Groups/Milieu: Patient enjoyed attending groups, particularly 
music therapy. Adjusted well to milieu. 

Risk Assessment: At no point during her hospitalization was self 
injury or suicidality an active clinical concern. The patient 
always expressed enthusiasm for her life and her family. Given 
her history of bipolar disorder, there is some chronic risk 
through time of suicidality or self injury. However this risk is 
reduced now that her mood has been stabilized and she continues 
to have ongoing structure and support outside of the hospital. 
Currently the patient is a low to moderate fall risk due to her 
history of orthostasis and recent falls prior to her 
hospitalization, however she is currently  ambulating well with 
a w cane and is conscious of need to take her time in standing 
up and adjust from dizziness. She demonstated a good awareness 
of this through out her hospitalization. Currently, there is no 
evidence of inability to care for herself in her current 
supported living situation.

STUDIES
AP chest radiograph (___), compared to ___: 
Impression: Borderline cardiomegaly is unchanged. Linear scar at 
the right lung base is slightly more extensive today than 
previously. No other focal pulmonary abnormality is present. 
Mild upper lobe vascular cephalization slightly more pronounced, 
but no edema or pleural effusion is present. 

Colonoscopy, (___):
Findings: Normal mucosa was noted. Protruding Lesions Three 
polyps of benign appearance were found. One sessile and one 
pedunculated polyp in the ascending colon and one pedunculated 
polyp in the transverse colon. The polyps ranged from 0.5 cm to 
0.8 cm Single-piece polypectomy was performed using a cold 
snare. The polyps were completely removed. Minimal oozing was 
noted at the polypectomy site at one of the polyps in the 
ascending colon. A single clip was attached and hemostasis was 
achieved.  
Impression: Polyps in the ascending colon and transverse colon 
(polypectomy). Normal mucosa in the colon. Otherwise normal 
colonoscopy to cecum. 

RUQ ultrasound, (___):
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other 
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including 
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on 
this study. 2. Gallstones with no signs of cholecystitis. 3. 
Simple bilateral renal cysts. Small left renal crystal within a 
calyceal diverticulum. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to Medicine service after having 
two episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
.
# GI bleeding: This bleeding was thought to be most likely from 
the distal GI tract given the description of bright red blood 
and the absence of epigastric pain, nausea or hematemesis. He 
was given IV fluid on the day of admission. His antihypertensive 
medications were held. He was evaluated by Gastrointestinal 
service who recommended colonoscopy and 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy especially because the patient has 
never had colonoscopy in the past and he has a history of 
chronic anemia. Colonoscopy revealed three benign-appearing, 
non-bleeding polyps, one in the transverse colon, and two in the 
ascending colon. There was no evidence of new or recent 
bleeding. Capsule endoscopy is recommended as further work up, 
to be done by the patient's PCP as outpatient.He did not have 
any further episodes of bleeding after he was admitted to 
Medicine survice. His hematocrit remained stable during this 
admission. Metroprolol 12.5 mg BID was resumed on the day of 
disposition. Other antihypertensive medications were stopped. 
The patient is to be followed up by his PCP, ___ on 
___.
.
# Normocytic anemia: The patient was found to have chronic 
anemia which has not been investigated as far as the patient's 
awared. His B12 and folate levels were both normal. Iron studies 
suggested that there may be a component of anemia of chronic 
disease. Acute bleeding would not totally account for this 
especially given that only a small to moderate amount of blood 
was noted with his bowel movements. The plan to further evaluate 
GI bleeding is capsule endoscopy as discussed above.
.  
# Coag-positive S. aureus UTI: Prior to this admission, the 
patient has already been treated with a full course of 
fluroquinolone (Ciprofloxacin followed by Levofloxacin). His 
urinalysis on admission was negative. He remained afebrile. His 
blood culture had NGTD at discharge.
.
# Elevated ESR and CRP: ESR is 108 (was 60 in ___ and ___, 
CRP 89.8 (CRP was 4 in ___. Differential diagnoses of elevated 
ESR and CRP include inflammation, infection or malignancy. 
Causes could be recent UTI, bacteremia, autoimmune processes or 
malignancy. PSA level was checked and was normal (0.1). ESR and 
CRP should be repeated at follow-up visit with Dr. ___.
.
# Transaminitis: AST 81-82, ALT 52-56. Last ALT in ___ was 
normal. Simvastatin was held on the day of admission. Tylenol 
level was checked, which was negative. Hepatitis serologies are 
pending at the time of disposition. His only new medication was 
levofloxacin, which may cause transaminis, but less likely in 
this case because AST and ALT levels remained elevated after he 
finished the course of antibiotic. The patient denied recent 
alcohol use. Other differential diagnoses include non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease, infectious, malignant or metastatic 
processes. LFTs should be repeated in ~1 week by his PCP as 
outpatient.
.
# Elevated direct bilirubin: Patient was found to have elevated 
direct bilirubin of 0.4, concerning for cholestatic proceses. On 
exam, he was afebrile and there was no RUQ or abdominal 
tenderness to palpation. No jaundice noted. RUQ ultrasound was 
obtained which showed fatty liver and gallstones but no evidence 
of inflammation or cholestasis. 
.
# Bilateral leg pain: Chronic issue. He was kept on dilaudid prn 
pain. His pain was well-controlled during this admission.
.
# Hypertension: Antihypertensive medications were held on the 
day of admission for GI bleeding and because patient was 
normotensive. His blood pressures during this admission ranged 
from 120-140's/60-70's. On disposition, only metoprolol was 
resumed with dose changed to 12.5 mg BID.  
.
# Right ankle pain: The patient developed ankle pain over the 
right medial malleolus. He reported that he has had many 
episodes of acute ""gout"" attacks in the past that lasted about 
___ days, the last episode happend about ___ years ago. He denied 
having had arthrocentesis. He reported that he went to the ED 
last time he had this type of pain but was told there was no 
treatment for his condition. He reported having had similar pain 
in both ankles and on the bottom of his feet several years ago. 
On exam, he was afebrile. There was minimal erythema over the 
right medial malleolus that was moderately tender to palpation 
and with passive range of movement. No swelling appreciated. 
Gout in differential. Patient already has a follow-up 
appointment with his PCP the day after disposition. In the 
meantime, he is instructed to take pain regimen as prescribed 
and to apply ice pack as needed.

==============
Acute Issues: 
==============
#Acute on chronic kidney injury: 
Patient with baseline creatinine of ~1.5. Was 1.7 post procedure 
on ___ AM and bumped to 2.1 on ___ AM. Acute kidney injury was 
thought to be pre-renal in etiology given FeNa calculated to 
0.23%. Held home furosemide and enalapril. Received fluid 
boluses with NS and administration of Albumin 25% (12.5g / 50mL) 
50 g IV. Improved to 1.8 at time of discharge.

with associated leukocytosis to 13.5 in AM ___. No localizing 
signs or symptoms and patient denied cough/dysuria. UA with few 
bacteria and negative leuk esterase/nitrites and was felt to be 
asymptomatic bacteruria. Differential diagnosis included post-op 
atelectasis versus RFA post ablation syndrome versus portal vein 
thrombosis given concomitant elevation in LFTs and ___ 
(described above). RUQ Doppler US performed with no evidence of 
portal vein thrombosis. No further febrile episodes and 
leukocytosis resolved ___ thus likely secondary to resolving 
atelectasis versus RFA post ablation syndrome.

# Urinary retention: Patient with urinary retention following 
procedure on ___. Felt to be secondary to anesthetic/opioid 
(oxycodone) effect. Required straight cath for 800 cc 1AM ___ 
and was straight cath'd for another 550cc at 3PM ___. 
Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO DAILY started ___ and low dose Tylenol 
added prn (max 2g/day given liver disease) to try to reduce 
amount of oxycodone required. Subsequently with improved 
urination on his own. Discharged on Tamsulosin. 

# ___ s/p RFA: Per ___, procedure itself went well but was 
subsequently complicated by transient, asymptomatic bradycardia. 
Patient with similar episode following TACE in ___. During 
that admission, patient was evaluated by EP who felt vasovagal 
in etiology. Was monitored on telemetry with no alarms for 
bradycardia. Pain controlled with Tylenol and oxycodone. 

# Sinus bradycardia: Patient with several episodes of 
asymptomatic bradycardia during and after the RFA procedure per 
___ report. He experienced this in ___ after his TACE 
procedure, which was evaluated by EP who felt this was a vagal 
response in setting of the procedure. Patient felt improved with 
no bradycardia on telemetry during hospital stay.

# EtOH/NASH cirrhosis: Complicated by grade I varices on EGD in 
___ and HCC as above. Patient to follow up in the ___ 
after discharge. Limited acetaminophen to 2g/day. 

# HTN: Patient on enalapril, amlodipine and furosemide at home. 
These medications were held prior to procedure and subsequently 
restarted. Enalapril and furosemide subsequently held due to 
___. Continued on amlodipine at discharge but discharged off 
enalapril and furosemide with plan to restart as outpatient. 

# DM: Complicated by neuropathy. Patient on glyburide, 36 units 
of glargine QHS and 24 units of Humalog with dinner. Continued 
Gabapentin 600 mg PO/NG TID during hospital stay. Maintained on 
ISS and 36 glargine QHS during hospital stay. 

# Vitamin D: Continued Vitamin D ___ UNIT PO/NG DAILY 

# Primary prevention: Restarted Aspirin 81 mg PO/NG DAILY post 
RFA; was holding for past few weeks for procedure. Continued 
simvastatin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was our pleasure caring for you during your hospital stay at 
___. 

You were admitted to the hospital after your RFA procedure due 
to some episodes of low heart rates during the procedure and 
because you were feeling dizzy after the procedure. We monitored 
you on the cardiac monitor and noted no additional periods of 
low heart rates. 

You had some difficulty urinating after the procedure that we 
think was due to a combination of the anesthesia and the pain 
killers (oxycodone) you were receiving. We started you on a new 
medication called tamsulosin that can help with difficulty 
urinating and that you should continue as an outpatient. We also 
gave you low dose Tylenol to decrease the amount of oxycodone 
you required for pain control. At the time of discharge, you 
were urinating on your own without difficulty. 

You additionally spiked a temperature while you were in the 
hospital but we did not detect any signs of infection. We think 
that the temperature may have been due to ""atelectasis"" or 
improper inflation of portions of your lung (a normal occurrence 
after procedures requiring anesthesia) or potentially due to the 
inflammation caused by the RFA procedure. We performed an 
ultrasound of your liver and we did not see anything concerning. 
You had no temperature and were breathing well on room air at 
the time of your discharge. 

Finally, your kidney function was a little worse following the 
procedure. We think that this was due to dehydration and it 
improved with the fluids and albumin we gave you.  We held your 
home Enalapril and Furosemide (Lasix) as these can affect your 
kidney function.  You should not restart these until you have 
your labs checked by your primary care physician at your next 
appointment.

You should follow up with your primary care physician and liver 
team after you leave the hospital. 

We wish you the best! 
Your ___ Care Team
